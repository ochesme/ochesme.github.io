It was about time that someone told Brenda what a mean, old gossiping person she is. Like Nelia, I will not also hesitate to tell Brenda that she should stop gossiping about people. Brenda!

Nelia got really mad at her. Well, this time, you'll be shocked at the good things that Brenda has been saying about you. I agree. But I think Brenda has changed now. She is no longer the old tsismosa that she was before . . . Look, here comes Brenda now. Wait! Don't be so quick to start a fight. Brenda has done nothing wrong.What was the dialog about​</a>

 Stone Soup
A kindly, old stranger was walking through the land when he came upon a village. As he entered, the villagers moved towards their homes locking doors and windows.
The stranger smiled and asked, why are you all so frightened. I am a simple traveler, looking for a soft place to stay for the night and a warm place for a meal.
"There's not a bite to eat in the whole province," he was told. "We are weak and our children are starving. Better keep moving on."
"Oh, I have everything I need," he said. "In fact, I was thinking of making some stone soup to share with all of you." He pulled an iron cauldron from his cloak, filled it with water, and began to build a fire under it.
Then, with great ceremony, he drew an ordinary-looking stone from a silken bag and dropped it into the water.
By now, hearing the rumor of food, most of the villagers had come out of their homes or watched from their windows. As the stranger sniffed the "broth" and licked his lips in anticipation, hunger began to overcome their fear.
"Ahh," the stranger said to himself rather loudly, "I do like a tasty stone soup. Of course, stone soup with cabbage -- that's hard to beat."
Soon a villager approached hesitantly, holding a small cabbage he'd retrieved from its hiding place, and added it to the pot.
"Wonderful!!" cried the stranger. "You know, I once had stone soup with cabbage and a bit of salt beef as well, and it was fit for a king."
The village butcher managed to find some salt beef . . . And so it went, through potatoes, onions, carrots, mushrooms, and so on, until there was indeed a delicious meal for everyone in the village to share.
The villager elder offered the stranger a great deal of money for the magic stone, but he refused to sell it and traveled on the next day.
As he left, the stranger came upon a group of village children standing near the road. He gave the silken bag containing the stone to the youngest child, whispering to a group, "It was not the stone, but the villagers that had performed the magic."

If there's something i'm not doing, girl i'm trying
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad (no no no)
If you see me at the party conversating
That doesn’t mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad
You should know, these
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
These
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)

The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.
Can you infer where I am?</a>

                                            •	Title of the Book: The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks
•	Excerpt:
	Afterward I sit in the chair that has come to be shaped like me. They are finishing up now; her clothes are on, but still she is crying. It will become quieter after they leave, I know. The excitement of the morning always upsets her, and today is no exception. Finally the shade is opened and the nurses walk out. Both of them touch me and smile as they walk by. I wonder what this means.
I sit for just a second and stare at her, but she doesn't return the look. I understand, for she doesn't know who I am. I'm a stranger to her. Then, turning away, I bow my head and pray silently for the strength I know I will need. I have always been a firm believer in God and the power of prayer, though to be honest, my faith has made for a list of questions I definitely want answered after I'm gone.
Ready now. On go the glasses, out of my pocket comes a magnifier. I put it on the table for a moment while I open the notebook. It takes two licks on my gnarled finger to get the well-worn cover open to the first page. Then I put the magnifier in place.
There is always a moment right before I begin to read the story when my mind churns, and I wonder, Will it happen today? I don't know, for I never know beforehand, and deep down it really doesn't matter. It's the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee, a sort of wager on my part. And though you may call me a dreamer or fool or any other thing, I believe that anything is possible.
I realize the odds, and science, are against me. But science is not the total answer; this I know, this I have learned in my lifetime. And that leaves me with the belief that miracles, no matter how inexplicable or unbelievable, are real and can occur without regard to the natural order of things. So once again, just as I do every day, I begin to read the notebook aloud, so that she can hear it, in the hope that the miracle that has come to dominate my life will once again prevail.
And maybe, just maybe, it will.

                                            Father’s LoveUnknown	One day a 12 years old girlasked her Father, “What is your gift for my next birthday? “Father smiled and said, “There is much time, so wait till your birthday my love.” Just after few days of this conversation, the girl fainted and was rushed to the Hospital. After checking on the girl, the Doctor came out and informed the family that the girl had a Bad Heart and probably will die. Everyone in the family was shocked after hearing the news and didn’t know what to do. While the girl was lying on the bed and her father was sitting near to her, the girl asked, “Daddy, am I going to die?” father replied, “No dear, you will live.” The father gave her warm hug and kissed her on her forehead and left weeping. The girl said, “How can you be so sure daddy?” Father turned around and replied, “I know” and smile.After some time the girl got treated and was recovering, at same time she turned 13. After she came home, she found a letter on her bed.	My Sweet Kid, if you are reading this, it means everything went well as I told you. Do you remember? Once you asked me what gift I will give for your Birthday. Well, at that time I did not know what I am going to give you, but now my Present to you is MY HEART”.	
 question: If you are a friend of that girl who’s father sacrifices himself, how can you help ease the       pain to prevent depression?​</a>

 Stone Soup
A kindly, old stranger was walking through the land when he came upon a village. As he entered, the villagers moved towards their homes locking doors and windows.
The stranger smiled and asked, why are you all so frightened. I am a simple traveler, looking for a soft place to stay for the night and a warm place for a meal.
"There's not a bite to eat in the whole province," he was told. "We are weak and our children are starving. Better keep moving on."
"Oh, I have everything I need," he said. "In fact, I was thinking of making some stone soup to share with all of you." He pulled an iron cauldron from his cloak, filled it with water, and began to build a fire under it.
Then, with great ceremony, he drew an ordinary-looking stone from a silken bag and dropped it into the water.
By now, hearing the rumor of food, most of the villagers had come out of their homes or watched from their windows. As the stranger sniffed the "broth" and licked his lips in anticipation, hunger began to overcome their fear.
"Ahh," the stranger said to himself rather loudly, "I do like a tasty stone soup. Of course, stone soup with cabbage -- that's hard to beat."
Soon a villager approached hesitantly, holding a small cabbage he'd retrieved from its hiding place, and added it to the pot.
"Wonderful!!" cried the stranger. "You know, I once had stone soup with cabbage and a bit of salt beef as well, and it was fit for a king."
The village butcher managed to find some salt beef . . . And so it went, through potatoes, onions, carrots, mushrooms, and so on, until there was indeed a delicious meal for everyone in the village to share.
The villager elder offered the stranger a great deal of money for the magic stone, but he refused to sell it and traveled on the next day.
As he left, the stranger came upon a group of village children standing near the road. He gave the silken bag containing the stone to the youngest child, whispering to a group, "It was not the stone, but the villagers that had performed the magic."

                            22. If i told i was perfect i'd be lying
If there's something i'm not doing, girl i'm trying
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad (no no no)
If you see me at the party conversating
That doesn’t mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad
You should know, these
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
These
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)

Questions :
1.Describe the type of life that the speaker has live.How do you know this ? Used evidence from the text to support your answer.
2.What advice is the mother giving to her son ?
3.What attitudes are revealed about the speaker ? List two and use evidence from the text.
4.What do the following lines mean :
A.Line # 2          C.Line # 14
B.Line # 9          D.Line # 17-18
PLEASE HELP THIS GUYS ... </h2><br />
                        1.Based on the poem, the speaker has lived miserably but was able to carry on in life despite the many challenges and trials she has experienced throughout her life. I could say so because the speaker, herself, expressed life in the poem as somewhat complex and toilsome. Her emphasis of the words from lines 2 up to 6 such as "life had tacks, splinters, boards torn up and is bare" all denotes life's perplexity and complexity.<br /><br />2. "Never give up. Keep on going son." These were the advises of the mother to his son.<br /><br />3. First, she is a fighter- "Life ain't been no crying crystal stair but all the time, I've been a climbin'on and readin' landin's and turning corners."<br />Second, she is optimistic- "For I still goin' honey, I've still climbin' and life ain't been no crystal stair without the word 'crying'."<br /><br />4. Line#2- Life has always been tough. It brings about personal turmoils and sadness.<br />Line#9- No giving up in life and just keep on going and trying.<br />Line#14- Don't get back, be strong enough to carry on in life.<br />Line#17&amp;18- Think positive, don't surrender, and stay hopeful. "We will face life together", mother to son.<br /><br />

The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.

                            26. •	Title of the Book: The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks
•	Excerpt:
	Afterward I sit in the chair that has come to be shaped like me. They are finishing up now; her clothes are on, but still she is crying. It will become quieter after they leave, I know. The excitement of the morning always upsets her, and today is no exception. Finally the shade is opened and the nurses walk out. Both of them touch me and smile as they walk by. I wonder what this means.
I sit for just a second and stare at her, but she doesn't return the look. I understand, for she doesn't know who I am. I'm a stranger to her. Then, turning away, I bow my head and pray silently for the strength I know I will need. I have always been a firm believer in God and the power of prayer, though to be honest, my faith has made for a list of questions I definitely want answered after I'm gone.
Ready now. On go the glasses, out of my pocket comes a magnifier. I put it on the table for a moment while I open the notebook. It takes two licks on my gnarled finger to get the well-worn cover open to the first page. Then I put the magnifier in place.
There is always a moment right before I begin to read the story when my mind churns, and I wonder, Will it happen today? I don't know, for I never know beforehand, and deep down it really doesn't matter. It's the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee, a sort of wager on my part. And though you may call me a dreamer or fool or any other thing, I believe that anything is possible.
I realize the odds, and science, are against me. But science is not the total answer; this I know, this I have learned in my lifetime. And that leaves me with the belief that miracles, no matter how inexplicable or unbelievable, are real and can occur without regard to the natural order of things. So once again, just as I do every day, I begin to read the notebook aloud, so that she can hear it, in the hope that the miracle that has come to dominate my life will once again prevail.
And maybe, just maybe, it will.
Question:
1.	What can you infer from the excerpt?
Answer:</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>From the excerpt, it can be inferred that the speaker is an elderly man who visits a woman in a hospital who seems to have memory loss or amnesia. He is familiar with the woman and is in the habit of reading to her from a notebook which contains a story. The woman appears upset and emotional, but the speaker believes that the story in the notebook may have the power to bring her comfort and healing. He expresses his faith in God and miracles, which he hopes will help the woman recover her memory.</p><br />

Father’s LoveUnknown	One day a 12 years old girlasked her Father, “What is your gift for my next birthday? “Father smiled and said, “There is much time, so wait till your birthday my love.” Just after few days of this conversation, the girl fainted and was rushed to the Hospital. After checking on the girl, the Doctor came out and informed the family that the girl had a Bad Heart and probably will die. Everyone in the family was shocked after hearing the news and didn’t know what to do. While the girl was lying on the bed and her father was sitting near to her, the girl asked, “Daddy, am I going to die?” father replied, “No dear, you will live.” The father gave her warm hug and kissed her on her forehead and left weeping. The girl said, “How can you be so sure daddy?” Father turned around and replied, “I know” and smile.After some time the girl got treated and was recovering, at same time she turned 13. After she came home, she found a letter on her bed.	My Sweet Kid, if you are reading this, it means everything went well as I told you. Do you remember? Once you asked me what gift I will give for your Birthday. Well, at that time I did not know what I am going to give you, but now my Present to you is MY HEART”.	
 question: If you are a friend of that girl who’s father sacrifices himself, how can you help ease the       pain to prevent depression?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If I was the girl's friend, I would comfort her, let her know that I'm hear to listen to her problems and let her know that I care. I would try to understand her troubles as best as I can.</p><br />
