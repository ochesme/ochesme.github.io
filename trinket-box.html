                                            Rich People Problems
an excerpt by Kevin Kwan
1 Bettina Ortiz y Meña was not accustomed to waiting. A former Miss
Venezuela and Miss Universe runner-up, of course, the exceedingly bronzed
strawberry blond was these days the wife of Miami auto-parts tycoon, Herman Ortiz
y Meña, and at every restaurant she chose to grace with her presence, she was
always greeted with reverence and whisked to the exact table she desired. Today she
wanted the corner table on the terrace at Sip Sip, her favorite lunch spot on Harbor
Island.
She wanted to sit on one of the comfy orange canvas director's chairs and
stare out at the gently lapping turquoise waters while eating her Kale Caesar salad,
but there was a large noisy group taking up the entire terrace and they didn't seem
in4nuch hurry to leave.
2 Bettina fumed as she glared at the tourists happily savoring their lunch in
the sun. Look how tacky they were...the woman overly tanned, wrinkled, and saggy,
none of them properly lifted or botoxed.
She felt like walking up to their table and handing out her dermatologist's
business cards. And the men were even worse. All dressed in all rumpled shirts and
shorts, wearing those cheap straw hats sold at the trinket shot on Dunmore Street.
Why did such people have to come here?
3 The three-and-a-half-mile-long paradise with its pristine pink-sand
beaches was one of the best-kept secrets in the Caribbean, a haven for the very rich
filled with quaint little wood houses painted in shades of sherbet, charmin
boutiques, chic oceanfront mansions turned into inns, and five-star restaurants to
rival St. Barths. Tourists should have to take a style exam before being allowed to
set foot on the Island! Feeling that she had been patient long enough, Bettina
stormed into the kitchen, the fringe on her crocheted Pucci caftan top shaking
furiously as she made a beeline for the woman with a shock of pixie-cut blond hair
manning the main stove.
4 "Julie, honey, what's the dealio? I've waited more than fifteen minute
my table!" Bettina sighed to the owner of the restaurant.
"Sorry, Bettina, it's been one of those days. The party of twelve on the ter
lowed up first just before you did," Julie replied as she handed off a bowl of spicy
conch chili to waiting server.
"But the terrace is your prime spot! Why on earth did you let those tourists
take up all that space?"
5 "Well, that tourist in the red fishing cap is the Duke of Glencora. His party
just boated over from Windermere - that's his Royal Huisman you see moored off
the coast. Isn't it the most handsome sailboat you've ever seen?"
6 "I'm not impressed by big boats," Bettina huffed, although secretly she wasThey even searched my walk-in freezer. See that Chinese fellow seated at the
end of the table?"
Bettina squinted through her Dior Extase sunglasses at the portly, balding,
seventy-something Asian man dressed in a nondescript white short-sleeved golf
shirt and gray trousers. "Oh, I didn't even notice him! Am I supposed to know who
he is?"
That's Alfred Shang, Julie said in a hushed tone.
&gt; Bettina giggled. "He looks like their chauffeur. Doesn't he look like that guy
that used to drive Jane Wyman around in Falcon Crest?"
Julie, who was trying to focus on searing a cut of tuna to perfection, shook her head
a tight-lipped smile. "From what I hear, that chauffeur is the most powerful man in
Asia."
"What's his name again?"

The Old Woman and the Doctor In a small village, there lived an old woman who had slowly lost her sight until she was completely blind. She was very poor, but she had a few fine pots and costly trinkets that she had collected for many years and treasured dearly. She decided to send for the doctor, for by selling her treasures she would be able to pay for his services. If only she could have her sight back, she would gladly live without her trinkets and treasures. DOCTOR OLD WOMAN The doctor came to the old woman's little hut, and they came to an agreement. If his treatment cured her blindness, she would give him a certain sum of money. But if she was not cured, she would give him nothing For many weeks, the doctor came daily to apply lotion and bandages to the old woman's eyes. Being a poor man himself, each time he visited, he took one of the woman's small treasures away with him. Each thing he took was so small that he did not think she would miss it. When the last bandages were removed, the woman had recovered her sight. She looked around her house, and saw that all of her treasures were gone. She declared that she would give the doctor nothing. The doctor insisted, but the old woman still refused. So he took her before the Judge. The old woman stood before the Judge and said, "This man speaks the truth. I did promise to pay him if his treatment cured my blindness, but if I continued to be blind, I was to give him nothing. Now he says that I am healed. I, however, assure you that I am still blind. For before I became blind, I saw all of my small treasures in my house. But even though he swears that I am cured, I cannot see a single one of my treasures now.' The Judge ruled that the old woman owed the doctor not a penny,pa answer po​</a>

                                            The Old Woman and the Doctor In a small village, there lived an old woman who had slowly lost her sight until she was completely blind. She was very poor, but she had a few fine pots and costly trinkets that she had collected for many years and treasured dearly. She decided to send for the doctor, for by selling her treasures she would be able to pay for his services. If only she could have her sight back, she would gladly live without her trinkets and treasures.</a>

Bettina Ortiz y Meña was not accustomed to waiting. A former Miss Venezuela and Miss Universe runner-up, of course, the exceedingly bronzed strawberry blond was these days the wife of Miami auto-parts tycoon, Herman Ortiz y Meña, and at every restaurant she chose to grace with her presence, she was always greeted with reverence and whisked to the exact table she desired. Today she wanted the corner table on the terrace at Sip Sip, her favor 
ite lunch spot on Harbor Island. She wanted to sit on one of the comfy orange canvas director’s chairs and stare out at the gently lapping turquoise waters while eating her Kale Caesar salad, but there was a large noisy group taking up the entire terrace and they didn’t seem in much hurry to leave. 
Bettina fumed as she glared at the tourists happily savoring their lunch in the sun. Look how tacky they were…the woman overly tanned, wrinkled and saggy, none of them properly lifted or botoxed. She felt like walking up to their table and handing out her dermatologist’s business cards. And the men were even worse. All dressed in all rumpled shirts and shorts, wearing those cheap straw hats sold at the trinket shot on Dunmore Street. Why did such people have to come here? 
The three-and-a-half-mile-long paradise with its pristine pink-sand beaches 
was one of the best-kept secrets in the Caribbean, a haven for the very rich filled with quaint little wood houses painted in shades of sherbet, charming boutiques, chic oceanfront mansions turned into inns, and five-star restaurants to rival St. Barths. Tourists should have to take a style exam before being allowed to set foot on the Island! Feeling that she had been patient long enough, Bettina stormed into the kitchen, the fringe on her crocheted Pucci caftan top shaking furiously as she made a beeline for the woman with a shock of pixie-cut blond hair manning the main stove. 
“Julie, honey, what’s the dealio? I’ve waited more than fifteen minutes for my table!” Bettina sighed to the owner of the restaurant. 
“Sorry, Bettina, it’s been one of those days. The party of twelve on the terrace showed up first just before you did,” Julie replied as she handed off a bowl of spicy conch chili to waiting server. 
“But the terrace is your prime spot! Why on earth did you let those tourists take up all that space?” 
“Well, that tourist in the red fishing cap is the Duke of Glencora. His party 
just boated over from Windermere – that’s his Royal Huisman you see moored off the coast. Isn’t it the most handsome sailboat you’ve ever seen?” 
“I’m not impressed by big boats,” Bettina huffed, although secretly 6 
she was rather impressed by people with big title. From the kitchen window, she surveyed the party assembled on the terrace with new eyes. These aristo British types were such a strange breed. Sure, they had their Savile Row suits and their heirloom tiaras, but when they traveled, they looked so painfully frumpy. 
It was only then that Bettina noticed three tan, well-built men in fitted 
white T-shirts and black Kevlar pants sitting at the adjacent table. The guys weren’t eating but sat watchfully, sipping glasses of seltzer water. “I assume that’s the duke’s security detail? They couldn’t be more obvious! Don’t they know that we’re all billionaires here on Briland, and this isn’t how we roll?” Bettina tut-tutted. 
“Actually, those bodyguards belong to the duke’s special guest. They did a 
whole sweep of the restaurant before the party arrived. They even searched my walk-in freezer. See that Chinese fellow seated at the end of the table?” Bettina squinted through her Dior Extase sunglasses at the portly, balding, seventy-something Asian man dressed in a nondescript white short-sleeved golf shirt and gray trousers. “Oh, I didn’t even notice him! Am I supposed to know who he is?” 
That’s Alfred Shang, Julie said in a hushed tone. 
Bettina giggled. “He looks like their chauffeur. Doesn’t he look like that guy 
that use to drive Jane Wyman around in Falcon Crest?” 
Julie, who was trying to focus on searing a cut of tuna to perfection, shook her head with a tight-lipped smile. “From what I hear, that chauffeur is the most powerful man in Asia.” 
“What’s his name again?”</a>

                            5. Rich People Problems
an excerpt by Kevin Kwan
1 Bettina Ortiz y Meña was not accustomed to waiting. A former Miss
Venezuela and Miss Universe runner-up, of course, the exceedingly bronzed
strawberry blond was these days the wife of Miami auto-parts tycoon, Herman Ortiz
y Meña, and at every restaurant she chose to grace with her presence, she was
always greeted with reverence and whisked to the exact table she desired. Today she
wanted the corner table on the terrace at Sip Sip, her favorite lunch spot on Harbor
Island.
She wanted to sit on one of the comfy orange canvas director's chairs and
stare out at the gently lapping turquoise waters while eating her Kale Caesar salad,
but there was a large noisy group taking up the entire terrace and they didn't seem
in4nuch hurry to leave.
2 Bettina fumed as she glared at the tourists happily savoring their lunch in
the sun. Look how tacky they were...the woman overly tanned, wrinkled, and saggy,
none of them properly lifted or botoxed.
She felt like walking up to their table and handing out her dermatologist's
business cards. And the men were even worse. All dressed in all rumpled shirts and
shorts, wearing those cheap straw hats sold at the trinket shot on Dunmore Street.
Why did such people have to come here?
3 The three-and-a-half-mile-long paradise with its pristine pink-sand
beaches was one of the best-kept secrets in the Caribbean, a haven for the very rich
filled with quaint little wood houses painted in shades of sherbet, charmin
boutiques, chic oceanfront mansions turned into inns, and five-star restaurants to
rival St. Barths. Tourists should have to take a style exam before being allowed to
set foot on the Island! Feeling that she had been patient long enough, Bettina
stormed into the kitchen, the fringe on her crocheted Pucci caftan top shaking
furiously as she made a beeline for the woman with a shock of pixie-cut blond hair
manning the main stove.
4 "Julie, honey, what's the dealio? I've waited more than fifteen minute
my table!" Bettina sighed to the owner of the restaurant.
"Sorry, Bettina, it's been one of those days. The party of twelve on the ter
lowed up first just before you did," Julie replied as she handed off a bowl of spicy
conch chili to waiting server.
"But the terrace is your prime spot! Why on earth did you let those tourists
take up all that space?"
5 "Well, that tourist in the red fishing cap is the Duke of Glencora. His party
just boated over from Windermere - that's his Royal Huisman you see moored off
the coast. Isn't it the most handsome sailboat you've ever seen?"
6 "I'm not impressed by big boats," Bettina huffed, although secretly she wasThey even searched my walk-in freezer. See that Chinese fellow seated at the
end of the table?"
Bettina squinted through her Dior Extase sunglasses at the portly, balding,
seventy-something Asian man dressed in a nondescript white short-sleeved golf
shirt and gray trousers. "Oh, I didn't even notice him! Am I supposed to know who
he is?"
That's Alfred Shang, Julie said in a hushed tone.
&gt; Bettina giggled. "He looks like their chauffeur. Doesn't he look like that guy
that used to drive Jane Wyman around in Falcon Crest?"
Julie, who was trying to focus on searing a cut of tuna to perfection, shook her head
a tight-lipped smile. "From what I hear, that chauffeur is the most powerful man in
Asia."
"What's his name again?"

                            7. Learning Tasks 4: Read read the story below. Using the Venn Diagram, think about how the characters are alike, and how they are different. The Old Woman and the Doctor In a small village, there lived an old woman who had slowly lost her sight until she was completely blind. She was very poor, but she had a few fine pots and costly trinkets that she had collected for many years and treasured dearly. She decided to send for the doctor, for by selling her treasures she would be able to pay for his services. If only she could have her sight back, she would gladly live without her trinkets and treasures. DOCTOR OLD WOMAN The doctor came to the old woman's little hut, and they came to an agreement. If his treatment cured her blindness, she would give him a certain sum of money. But if she was not cured, she would give him nothing For many weeks, the doctor came daily to apply lotion and bandages to the old woman's eyes. Being a poor man himself, each time he visited, he took one of the woman's small treasures away with him. Each thing he took was so small that he did not think she would miss it. When the last bandages were removed, the woman had recovered her sight. She looked around her house, and saw that all of her treasures were gone. She declared that she would give the doctor nothing. The doctor insisted, but the old woman still refused. So he took her before the Judge. The old woman stood before the Judge and said, "This man speaks the truth. I did promise to pay him if his treatment cured my blindness, but if I continued to be blind, I was to give him nothing. Now he says that I am healed. I, however, assure you that I am still blind. For before I became blind, I saw all of my small treasures in my house. But even though he swears that I am cured, I cannot see a single one of my treasures now.'

“I’m not impressed by big boats,” Bettina huffed, although secretly 6 
she was rather impressed by people with big title. From the kitchen window, she surveyed the party assembled on the terrace with new eyes. These aristo British types were such a strange breed. Sure, they had their Savile Row suits and their heirloom tiaras, but when they traveled, they looked so painfully frumpy. 
It was only then that Bettina noticed three tan, well-built men in fitted 
white T-shirts and black Kevlar pants sitting at the adjacent table. The guys weren’t eating but sat watchfully, sipping glasses of seltzer water. “I assume that’s the duke’s security detail? They couldn’t be more obvious! Don’t they know that we’re all billionaires here on Briland, and this isn’t how we roll?” Bettina tut-tutted. 
“Actually, those bodyguards belong to the duke’s special guest. They did a 
whole sweep of the restaurant before the party arrived. They even searched my walk-in freezer.
