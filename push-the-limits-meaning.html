b. Yes, because in the end a lot of people can benefit from these infrastructures in one way or another.
c. No, but if they only choose small portion of land to build the infrastructures then it is just reasonable and fine.

a. No, because our control and authority are only limited to the non-human beings and not directly to the environment itself.
b. Yes, the Divine Creator has granted us this power of free will and reason and it is up to us as to how we make use of His Creation by any means possible.
c. Yes, because we are created by His image and likeness, and we are tasked to rule over His creation. Thus, we are allowed to do anything we want to the environment and even to the non-human beings.
d. No, because as stewards of God, though we have the freedom and authority to control over His creation, we are always reminded about our moral responsibility to take care, protect, and respect the environment and not to use it for own expense.
39. There is an ongoing project on your Barangay yet, you overheard what this project is all about and has the potential to harm the environment. As a SK councilor, what will you do? *

a. Mika is milk tea lover so she always buys it every other day. She realized that she always consumes plastic from its container down to the straw, that’s why she decided to bring her own container and metal straw next time.
b. Cindy is a real estate developer. In order to make more profits, she usually goes to vacant lands and mountainous areas that no one seems to own and cut down the trees endlessly to build some homes and other infrastructures to generate more income.
c. Andrew buys his conditioner and shampoo in a sari-sari store nearby. Eventually, he realized that a lot of plastics have been used because of its container, that’s why he decided to go instead to the supermarket every month and buy shampoo, conditioner, and other stuff in bulks.
d. Hannah is the town mayor of one of the cities in Cebu. She noticed that it became hotter in the surrounding areas, and the pollution worsens, when they started building the expressway above the river.

                                            A. Face-to Face Classes a&gt; FACE TO FACE (The Philippine Star) December 1, 2020-12:00am Based on reports from the field, education officials themselves have reported the difficulties being encountered by students in blended leaming. Apart from intermittent WiFi connection or lack of access to gadgets and the internet, there are school children who lack a private space at home that is conducive to learning. Many students also need learning assistance from their parents. And there are parents who are unprepared to take on the role of tutors, either because they need to earn a living while their children are in school, or else because they lack the knowledge and skills required for the task. Faced with such challenges, education officials are now discussing the possibility of resurning limited face-to-face classes as soon as circumstances allow. If the plan pushes through, the initial areas for the resumption will be those without COVID transmission over a certain period. The Office of the Vice President has become embroiled in another controversy as Department of Education officials denied giving the green light for the Community Learning Hubs set up by the OVP in several areas. The OVP has clarified that the hubs are not rooms where face-to-face classes are held, but areas similar to internet shops, where school children without gadge's or WiF) at home can access the internet for their online classes. Difficult leamers can also have access to tutors at the hubs. The seats are spaced following distancing protocols and are separated by transparent acrylic dividers. Similar setups have been implemented in several countries where on-site classroom leaming has resumed following a significant downward trend in coronavirus transmission. In recent weeks, however, some of the countries had to suspend the classes anew following a fresh wave of COVID cases. These developments are being monitored by DepEd officials amid discussions on the gradual resumption of face-to-face classes. President Duterte has said there will be no face-to-face dasses until a COVID vaccine becomes available. The position may have to be modified, however, if only to reduce the number of students being left behind as a result of pandemic restrictions. With the end of late enrollment on Nov. 21, the DepEd reported nearly 25 million total enrollees in both public and private elementary and high schools. This means about two million students are out of school for this academic year. With face-to-face classes still banned, the government must find innovative ways of promoting safe and indusive learning.​</a>

c. Andrew buys his conditioner and shampoo in a sari-sari store nearby. Eventually, he realized that a lot of plastics have been used because of its container, that’s why he decided to go instead to the supermarket every month and buy shampoo, conditioner, and other stuff in bulks.

                            17. A. Face-to Face Classes a&gt; FACE TO FACE (The Philippine Star) December 1, 2020-12:00am Based on reports from the field, education officials themselves have reported the difficulties being encountered by students in blended leaming. Apart from intermittent WiFi connection or lack of access to gadgets and the internet, there are school children who lack a private space at home that is conducive to learning. Many students also need learning assistance from their parents. And there are parents who are unprepared to take on the role of tutors, either because they need to earn a living while their children are in school, or else because they lack the knowledge and skills required for the task. Faced with such challenges, education officials are now discussing the possibility of resurning limited face-to-face classes as soon as circumstances allow. If the plan pushes through, the initial areas for the resumption will be those without COVID transmission over a certain period. The Office of the Vice President has become embroiled in another controversy as Department of Education officials denied giving the green light for the Community Learning Hubs set up by the OVP in several areas. The OVP has clarified that the hubs are not rooms where face-to-face classes are held, but areas similar to internet shops, where school children without gadge's or WiF) at home can access the internet for their online classes. Difficult leamers can also have access to tutors at the hubs. The seats are spaced following distancing protocols and are separated by transparent acrylic dividers. Similar setups have been implemented in several countries where on-site classroom leaming has resumed following a significant downward trend in coronavirus transmission. In recent weeks, however, some of the countries had to suspend the classes anew following a fresh wave of COVID cases. These developments are being monitored by DepEd officials amid discussions on the gradual resumption of face-to-face classes. President Duterte has said there will be no face-to-face dasses until a COVID vaccine becomes available. The position may have to be modified, however, if only to reduce the number of students being left behind as a result of pandemic restrictions. With the end of late enrollment on Nov. 21, the DepEd reported nearly 25 million total enrollees in both public and private elementary and high schools. This means about two million students are out of school for this academic year. With face-to-face classes still banned, the government must find innovative ways of promoting safe and indusive learning.​</h2><br />
