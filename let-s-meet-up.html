And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled, As it ran light, or had to bear a load. And nothing happened: day was all but done, Call it a day, I wish they might have said To please the boy by giving him the half hour That a boy counts so much when saved from work. His sister stood beside them in her apron To tell them "Supper." At the word, the saw, As if to prove saws knew what supper meant, Leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap- y He must have given the hand. However it was, Neither refused the meeting. But the hand! at The boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh, As he swung toward them holding up the hand Half in appeal, but half as if to keep A The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all- Since he was old enough to know, big boy it Doing a man's work, though a child at heart- all He saw all spoiled. "Don't let him cut my hand off- The doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister!" n So. But the hand was gone already. e The doctor put him in the dark of ether. S, He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath. ed And then the watcher at his pulse took fright. $; No one believed. They listened at his heart. Little-less-nothing! --and that ended it. art No more to build on there. And they, since they Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs. 1. What happens in this poem? 2.

                                            " THE OWL AND THE WOODPECKER"Once upon a time, in a a forest far away, there lived a woodpecker. The woodpecker lived in a tree in which he slept all night and worked all day.In the tree next door, there came to live an owl who liked to work all night and slept all day.The woodpecker worked so hard and made so much noise that his tapping woke the owl. You see, a woodpecker pecks at the wood and makes a continuous tapping sound."I say, you there!" screeched the owl. "How can I possibly sleep with all that noise going on?""This is my three," the woodpecker said, "and I shall tap it as I please."The owl lost his temper. His screeches and hoots echoed through the forest and animals for miles came running to see what was the matter."You carry on tapping, Master Woodpecker," squeked the mouse. "Owl is always bossing and chasing us about,""Oh, do be quiet," growled the bear, "Woodpecker, stop tapping and let Owl sleep. We like a peaceful life around here."Angrily, the owl swooped down on the small animals who ran for their lives and hid in all kinds of curious places. "Bully," they shouted when they were very safe.Then the owl ask the bigger animals what he could do to stop the noise but they all shook their heads. "How should we know?" they said. "You are the wise and clever one. Perhaps you could move to another tree.""Why should I?" snapped the owl. "I like living in this tree. That noisy woodpecker must move."But the woodpecker would not move. Day after day, his noisy tapping kept the owl awake. And day after the day the became more and more bad-tempered. He began to be so crotchety and rude that all the other animals decided that something must be done.So they held a meeting."Something must be dome," said the badger."Woodpecker was here first, so owl must leave.""But he says he will not leave his tree," replied the Deer"In that case we shall have to push down the tree, and then he will have to leave," said the crafty Fox.That night, while the owl was out hunting they all tried to push down tree. But no matter how hard they pushed and pulled and panted they could not move the tree the smallest bit. So they gave up and went back home.Some time later, two strangers came to the forest. They were a pair of beavers, and the took fancy to the owl's tree, and started to gnaw at the trunk.Every day they gnawed a little more, until it seemed as if they would gnaw the trunk right through.Then one day a great storm shook the forest. The wind roared through the trees. It was so strong the woodpecker gave up tapping, and so for once, the owl slept in peace. The owl's tree began to creak and crack and groan as the wind grew more and more fierce, but the tired owl slept soundly on.Suddenly the woodpecker saw the owl's tree begin to away and fall. At once he struggled bravely through the storm and tapped loudly close to the owl's ear to wake him. The owl woke up in a fury, hearing the woodpecker tapping on his tree, but when realized his tree was being blown down his anger quickly disappeared. Together the woodpecker and the owl struggled to safety just as the tree crashed to the ground.Then the storm died away, and the owl thanked the woodpecker for saving his life. Now he was glad that the woodpecker had been his neighbor.--------------------------------The map below is called the story grammar map. Write the missing elements of the story in it.

And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled, As it ran light, or had to bear a load. And nothing happened: day was all but done, Call it a day, I wish they might have said To please the boy by giving him the half hour That a boy counts so much when saved from work. His sister stood beside them in her apron To tell them "Supper." At the word, the saw, As if to prove saws knew what supper meant, Leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap- y He must have given the hand. However it was, Neither refused the meeting. But the hand! at The boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh, As he swung toward them holding up the hand Half in appeal, but half as if to keep A The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all- Since he was old enough to know, big boy it Doing a man's work, though a child at heart- all He saw all spoiled. "Don't let him cut my hand off- The doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister!" n So. But the hand was gone already. e The doctor put him in the dark of ether. S, He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath. ed And then the watcher at his pulse took fright. $; No one believed. They listened at his heart.

                            9. " THE OWL AND THE WOODPECKER"Once upon a time, in a a forest far away, there lived a woodpecker. The woodpecker lived in a tree in which he slept all night and worked all day.In the tree next door, there came to live an owl who liked to work all night and slept all day.The woodpecker worked so hard and made so much noise that his tapping woke the owl. You see, a woodpecker pecks at the wood and makes a continuous tapping sound."I say, you there!" screeched the owl. "How can I possibly sleep with all that noise going on?""This is my three," the woodpecker said, "and I shall tap it as I please."The owl lost his temper. His screeches and hoots echoed through the forest and animals for miles came running to see what was the matter."You carry on tapping, Master Woodpecker," squeked the mouse. "Owl is always bossing and chasing us about,""Oh, do be quiet," growled the bear, "Woodpecker, stop tapping and let Owl sleep. We like a peaceful life around here."Angrily, the owl swooped down on the small animals who ran for their lives and hid in all kinds of curious places. "Bully," they shouted when they were very safe.Then the owl ask the bigger animals what he could do to stop the noise but they all shook their heads. "How should we know?" they said. "You are the wise and clever one. Perhaps you could move to another tree.""Why should I?" snapped the owl. "I like living in this tree. That noisy woodpecker must move."But the woodpecker would not move. Day after day, his noisy tapping kept the owl awake. And day after the day the became more and more bad-tempered. He began to be so crotchety and rude that all the other animals decided that something must be done.So they held a meeting."Something must be dome," said the badger."Woodpecker was here first, so owl must leave.""But he says he will not leave his tree," replied the Deer"In that case we shall have to push down the tree, and then he will have to leave," said the crafty Fox.That night, while the owl was out hunting they all tried to push down tree. But no matter how hard they pushed and pulled and panted they could not move the tree the smallest bit. So they gave up and went back home.Some time later, two strangers came to the forest. They were a pair of beavers, and the took fancy to the owl's tree, and started to gnaw at the trunk.Every day they gnawed a little more, until it seemed as if they would gnaw the trunk right through.Then one day a great storm shook the forest. The wind roared through the trees. It was so strong the woodpecker gave up tapping, and so for once, the owl slept in peace. The owl's tree began to creak and crack and groan as the wind grew more and more fierce, but the tired owl slept soundly on.Suddenly the woodpecker saw the owl's tree begin to away and fall. At once he struggled bravely through the storm and tapped loudly close to the owl's ear to wake him. The owl woke up in a fury, hearing the woodpecker tapping on his tree, but when realized his tree was being blown down his anger quickly disappeared. Together the woodpecker and the owl struggled to safety just as the tree crashed to the ground.Then the storm died away, and the owl thanked the woodpecker for saving his life. Now he was glad that the woodpecker had been his neighbor.--------------------------------The map below is called the story grammar map. Write the missing elements of the story in it.
