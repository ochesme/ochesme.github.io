                                            1. Distance vs. displacement The distance is the length of path between the initial and final position of the object. It can be expressed as: Distance= initial position + final position (d= di + di The length in which the bicycle rider (in the illustration above) covers from initial position (from rest) to his final destination referred to the distance. Meanwhile, displacement is the net change in position of an object. It is expressed as: Ad = d-do Displacement di = final position Greek letter delta, A, means change in do = initial position If the final position is the same as the initial position, the Ad=0; meaning it cancelled each other out when added together. Take for example: A man driving a tricycle from home headed to a gasoline station to load gas which is 5 km away. After loading the gas, it heads back home covering a total distance of 10 km since the tricycle ended up in the same starting point. Hence; Ad = d-doo = Ad=5 km from gasoline station to original position-5 km from original position to gasoline station Explain when the displacement of an object is equal to zero? Answer:​</a>

                                            Read the news article below and answer the questions that follow.Around a third of the ice shelves holding back huge glaciers in Antarctica are at risk of collapse if the world fails to take sufficient action on climate change, new projections have found.The ice shelves circling the continent are vulnerable to meltwater on their surface causing the ice to crack and disintegrate, a process known as hydrofracturing.Computer modelling by Ella Gilbert at the University of Reading, UK, and Christoph Kittel at the University of Liege, Belgium, showed that if the world warms by 4°C since pre-industrial levels, then 34 per cent of the continent’s ice shelves will have meltwater on their surface, a sign they are at risk of collapse.However, the figure falls to 18 per cent if temperature rises are checked at 2°C. The world is currently on track for a 2.9°C rise but, if implemented, climate plans and net zero goals would cut that to 2.1°C.“Warming to 2°C means half the ice shelf area is at risk of collapsing. That is the message: the less the warming the better,” says Gilbert.She and Kittel used a much higher resolution climate model than previous research, with grid squares 35 kilometres across rather than hundreds of kilometres across. It also more accurately represents cloud physics, which is vital as estimates of the area at risk of collapse hinge on how much ice loss is replaced by snowfall. The big difference between the 2°C and 4°C rise scenarios stems from melting outweighing increased snowfall in a 4°C warmer world.The Larsen C ice shelf on the east of the Antarctic Peninsula, where a huge iceberg broke off in 2017, was found to be one of the areas most at risk.“This study shows melting at the ice shelves’ surface will spreads southwards to parts of the continent where huge reservoirs of inland ice may lose their protective barrier. If that happens, we can expect rapid increases in sea level rise along every coastline of our planet,” says Andrew Shepherd at the University of Leeds, UK, who wasn’t involved with the paper.The research doesn’t put a figure on how much sea level rise could occur if ice shelves collapsed and released the glaciers behind them. However, Gilbert says: “My gut feeling is for 4°C it could potentially contribute tens of centimetres if they did collapse.” Avoiding 10 centimetres of sea level rise should expose 10 million fewer people globally to flooding risks.Helene Seroussi at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, who wasn’t part of the research team, says the study’s big advance is using a higher resolution model. While the research identifies ice shelves that could be hydrofractured, Seroussi says further analysis of how individual ice shelves move – the “dynamical stress regime” – is needed to work out which ones will actually collapse.1. What impact of climate change is presented in the given article?2. According to the computer model made by Gilbert and Kittel, what will happen if the world warms by 4'C?3. How will you elaborate the statement made by Gilbert, "the less the warming, the better"?4. What are the possible impacts to the environment and mankind if the ice shelves collapse?5. In your opinion, how many the people help to lesson the effect of climate change?​</a>

                                            You like money, right? Most people do. But what is it really worth? Usually, it will buy the goods and services that you expect. But sometimes it's worth less than the paper that it's printed on. I know that sounds hard to believe, but it's happened before.
During World War I, the French and the Germans fought one another fiercely. The war exacted a tremendous cost on both sides. Millions died. Billions of dollars were spent. The French paid for their efforts by taxing their citizens. But the Germans borrowed money to pay for the war. As the war raged on and the Germans borrowed more and more money, the value of their currency dropped.
In those days, the Germans called their money Marks. When World War I started in 1914, a US Dollar was worth around four German Marks. In 1919, after the war ended, a US Dollar was worth about nine German Marks. That means that Germans needed to spend twice as much money to buy the same items after the war. This is called inflation. Since people usually don't start earning twice as much money out of nowhere, it can be a real problem.
While 100% inflation over five years sounds pretty bad, things got much worse after the war. The countries that fought against Germany were upset with them. The French were perhaps most upset. Much of the fighting took place in France, and the country was ravaged. Since France and her allies won the war, they got to set the terms of surrender. France wanted billions of dollars each year. They demanded payments in foreign money, like the US Dollar, not in German Marks.
It was early 1921 by the time these agreements were made. One US Dollar could buy 60 German Marks. Then the Germans started making payments. Things soon spiraled out of control. The Germans made these payments by printing money. They would trade the money that they printed for foreign currency. But as they printed more and more, the money was worth less and less.  In November of 1921, one US Dollar was worth 330 Marks. A year later, one US Dollar was worth 800 German Marks.
The German government grew desperate. They began to trade Marks for foreign money at any rate. This only made things worse. By November of 1923, one US Dollar could buy 4,210,500,000,000 Marks.  That is not a typo. The number is 4 trillion. Their money was devalued so fast that German workers had to go to the store right after getting paid. If they waited until the day's end, their money would be worthless. Basic items like stamps and loaves of bread cost billions of Marks. Germans had to figure their expenses in thousands of billions. That made it tough to get through the day if you lacked strong math skills. Some burned the old bills to provide heat. The Marks' value as a fuel had increased beyond its value as a currency.
That the German economy ever recovered is something of a miracle, but it did recover. They created a new currency called the Retenmark. Unlike the old Marks, the new Retenmark was backed by land and gold. This means the currency could be traded for gold or land at a fixed rate. This also meant that the government could only print as much money as they had land and gold to back it. That turned out to be a good thing. By December of 1923, the Retenmark was the official currency. The Germans cut 12 zeros from the prices of their products and it was business as usual. Though they still had a lot of issues to work out, the money was stable. That made life a lot more livable. So while you are out chasing after money, remember that money is little more than a promise, and that promises can be broken. What is one lesson that can be learned from the text?

                                            A mystory is a story based on a puzzling crime. Usually a mystery involves an objects disappearance or a person's untimely death. The main character, the detective, must use common sense and intelligence to solve the crime. He or the will search for clues and evidence that will answer the question "Whodunit? Clues can be items such as fingerprints or notes, or the witnessing of conversations or secret actions. Some of the other characters in a mystery are suspects, people who may have committed the crime. Although at first it appears that any one of the suspects may have committed the crime, the detective eventually narrows the possibilities Often the detective interviews suspects to learn who had the means, motive, and opportunity to commit the crime. He or she also seeks to learn alibis, suspects locations at the time the crime was committed Suspense and red herrings are common elements of mysteries. A writer must capture the reader's attention and make him or her want to read on to learn the solution to the mystery. Dark and dreary settings can help add suspense to a mystery. Red herrings, false or misleading clues, are sometimes included to direct a reader's suspicions away from the criminal toward other characters in the story who have a weak alibi or a strong motive. Eventually, however, the detective rules out such people and zeros in on the criminal. The solution to the mystery is revealed in the part of the story called the denouement. This takes place at the end of the story, after the detective has explored all possibilities. The guilty party is exposed and the story ends.

                                            Around a third of the ice shelves holding back huge glaciers in Antarctica are at risk of collapse if the world fails to take sufficient action on climate change, new projections have found.The ice shelves circling the continent are vulnerable to meltwater on their surface causing the ice to crack and disintegrate, a process known as hydrofracturing.Computer modelling by Ella Gilbert at the University of Reading, UK, and Christoph Kittel at the University of Liege, Belgium, showed that if the world warms by 4°C since pre-industrial levels, then 34 per cent of the continent’s ice shelves will have meltwater on their surface, a sign they are at risk of collapse.However, the figure falls to 18 per cent if temperature rises are checked at 2°C. The world is currently on track for a 2.9°C rise but, if implemented, climate plans and net zero goals would cut that to 2.1°C.“Warming to 2°C means half the ice shelf area is at risk of collapsing. That is the message: the less the warming the better,” says Gilbert.She and Kittel used a much higher resolution climate model than previous research, with grid squares 35 kilometers across rather than hundreds of kilometers across. It also more accurately represents cloud physics, which is vital as estimates of the area at risk of collapse hinge on how much ice loss is replaced by snowfall. The big difference between the 2°C and 4°C rise scenarios stems from melting outweighing increased snowfall in a 4°C warmer world.The Larsen C ice shelf on the east of the Antarctic Peninsula, where a huge iceberg broke off in 2017, was found to be one of the areas most at risk.“This study shows melting at the ice shelves’ surface will spread southwards to parts of the continent where huge reservoirs of inland ice may lose their protective barrier. If that happens, we can expect rapid increases in sea level rise along every coastline of our planet,” says Andrew Shepherd at the University of Leeds, UK, who wasn’t involved with the paper.The research doesn’t put a figure on how much sea level rise could occur if ice shelves collapsed and released the glaciers behind them. However, Gilbert says: “My gut feeling is for 4°C it could potentially contribute tens of centimeters if they did collapse.” Avoiding 10 centimeters of sea level rise should expose 10 million fewer people globally to flooding risks.Helene Seroussi at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, who wasn’t part of the research team, says the study’s big advance is using a higher resolution model. While the research identifies ice shelves that could be hydrofractured, Seroussi says further analysis of how individual ice shelves move – the “dynamical stress regime” – is needed to work out which ones will actually collapse.1.

The signal words may help you identify the pattern of development, but it is more important that youunderstand the meaning of text15. "In the meantime" is a signal word for comparing,16. Various factors must be considered in identifying the effectiveness of a particular text.17. Knowing the components of a text or composition to further understand the properties of a well-written text isoptional.18. A composition can either be a paragraph or an essay. A paragraph is a group of Interrelated sentences thattalk about one main idea while an essay is a group of paragraphs thattalk about one central idea.19. In an essay, the body begins with the restatement of the thesis statement using a different structure andwording to uphold the language style.20. Cohesive devices are sentences that clarify and prove the main idea21. Unlike a paragraph, an essay has a more elaborate structure22. Unity is achieved when a composition contains several distinct ideas.23. Cohesion occurs when ideas are connected at the conceptual or Idea level. It can be seen through well-defended arguments and organized points.24. Coherence is the connection of ideas at the sentence level. It can be readily seen in a text through the smoothflow of the sentences and the connection of the ideas.25. The technical aspect of writing, also known as mechanics, should not be overlooked when writing. The use ofcontractions (eg, shouldn't) is encouraged and numbers from zero to ten should be spelled out while numbershigher than ten should be written In figures.​</a>

                            1. The numerator and denominator was found out to be both equal zero, what does it mean?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A numerator is allowed to take on the value of zero in a fraction. Any legal fraction (denominator not equal to zero) with a numerator equal to zero has an overall value of zero. This means, <strong>all have a fraction value of zero</strong> because the numerators are equal to zero.
</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>The denominator of any fraction cannot have the value zero. if the denominator is a fraction is zero, the <strong>expression </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>not </strong><strong>legal </strong><strong>fraction </strong>because its overall value is undefined.are not legal fraction, their value's are all undefined, and hence they have no meaning. </p><br />

                            2. In total destructive interference, when the interfering pulses are completely out of phase,waves disappear and the amplitude of the wave becomes zero. Does this mean that the energycarried by the waves get destroyed? Explain.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Wave interference is the phenomenon that occurs when two waves meet while traveling along the same medium. The interference of waves causes the medium to take on a shape that results from the net effect of the two individual waves upon the particles of the medium. To begin our exploration of wave interference, consider two pulses of the same amplitude traveling in different directions along the same medium. Let's suppose that each displaced upward 1 unit at its crest and has the shape of a sine wave. As the sine pulses move towards each other, there will eventually be a moment in time when they are completely overlapped. At that moment, the resulting shape of the medium would be an upward displaced sine pulse with an amplitude of 2 units. The diagrams below depict the before and during interference snapshots of the medium for two such pulses. The individual sine pulses are drawn in red and blue and the resulting displacement of the medium is drawn in green.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>i dunno if this was the answer that you wanted to see but i hope this helps</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            14. 1. Distance vs. displacement The distance is the length of path between the initial and final position of the object. It can be expressed as: Distance= initial position + final position (d= di + di The length in which the bicycle rider (in the illustration above) covers from initial position (from rest) to his final destination referred to the distance. Meanwhile, displacement is the net change in position of an object. It is expressed as: Ad = d-do Displacement di = final position Greek letter delta, A, means change in do = initial position If the final position is the same as the initial position, the Ad=0; meaning it cancelled each other out when added together. Take for example: A man driving a tricycle from home headed to a gasoline station to load gas which is 5 km away. After loading the gas, it heads back home covering a total distance of 10 km since the tricycle ended up in the same starting point. Hence; Ad = d-doo = Ad=5 km from gasoline station to original position-5 km from original position to gasoline station Explain when the displacement of an object is equal to zero? Answer:​</h2><br />

                            16. Read the news article below and answer the questions that follow.Around a third of the ice shelves holding back huge glaciers in Antarctica are at risk of collapse if the world fails to take sufficient action on climate change, new projections have found.The ice shelves circling the continent are vulnerable to meltwater on their surface causing the ice to crack and disintegrate, a process known as hydrofracturing.Computer modelling by Ella Gilbert at the University of Reading, UK, and Christoph Kittel at the University of Liege, Belgium, showed that if the world warms by 4°C since pre-industrial levels, then 34 per cent of the continent’s ice shelves will have meltwater on their surface, a sign they are at risk of collapse.However, the figure falls to 18 per cent if temperature rises are checked at 2°C. The world is currently on track for a 2.9°C rise but, if implemented, climate plans and net zero goals would cut that to 2.1°C.“Warming to 2°C means half the ice shelf area is at risk of collapsing. That is the message: the less the warming the better,” says Gilbert.She and Kittel used a much higher resolution climate model than previous research, with grid squares 35 kilometres across rather than hundreds of kilometres across. It also more accurately represents cloud physics, which is vital as estimates of the area at risk of collapse hinge on how much ice loss is replaced by snowfall. The big difference between the 2°C and 4°C rise scenarios stems from melting outweighing increased snowfall in a 4°C warmer world.The Larsen C ice shelf on the east of the Antarctic Peninsula, where a huge iceberg broke off in 2017, was found to be one of the areas most at risk.“This study shows melting at the ice shelves’ surface will spreads southwards to parts of the continent where huge reservoirs of inland ice may lose their protective barrier. If that happens, we can expect rapid increases in sea level rise along every coastline of our planet,” says Andrew Shepherd at the University of Leeds, UK, who wasn’t involved with the paper.The research doesn’t put a figure on how much sea level rise could occur if ice shelves collapsed and released the glaciers behind them. However, Gilbert says: “My gut feeling is for 4°C it could potentially contribute tens of centimetres if they did collapse.” Avoiding 10 centimetres of sea level rise should expose 10 million fewer people globally to flooding risks.Helene Seroussi at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, who wasn’t part of the research team, says the study’s big advance is using a higher resolution model. While the research identifies ice shelves that could be hydrofractured, Seroussi says further analysis of how individual ice shelves move – the “dynamical stress regime” – is needed to work out which ones will actually collapse.1.

                            19. You like money, right? Most people do. But what is it really worth? Usually, it will buy the goods and services that you expect. But sometimes it's worth less than the paper that it's printed on. I know that sounds hard to believe, but it's happened before.
During World War I, the French and the Germans fought one another fiercely. The war exacted a tremendous cost on both sides. Millions died. Billions of dollars were spent. The French paid for their efforts by taxing their citizens. But the Germans borrowed money to pay for the war. As the war raged on and the Germans borrowed more and more money, the value of their currency dropped.
In those days, the Germans called their money Marks. When World War I started in 1914, a US Dollar was worth around four German Marks. In 1919, after the war ended, a US Dollar was worth about nine German Marks. That means that Germans needed to spend twice as much money to buy the same items after the war. This is called inflation. Since people usually don't start earning twice as much money out of nowhere, it can be a real problem.
While 100% inflation over five years sounds pretty bad, things got much worse after the war. The countries that fought against Germany were upset with them. The French were perhaps most upset. Much of the fighting took place in France, and the country was ravaged. Since France and her allies won the war, they got to set the terms of surrender. France wanted billions of dollars each year. They demanded payments in foreign money, like the US Dollar, not in German Marks.
It was early 1921 by the time these agreements were made. One US Dollar could buy 60 German Marks. Then the Germans started making payments. Things soon spiraled out of control. The Germans made these payments by printing money. They would trade the money that they printed for foreign currency. But as they printed more and more, the money was worth less and less.  In November of 1921, one US Dollar was worth 330 Marks. A year later, one US Dollar was worth 800 German Marks.
The German government grew desperate. They began to trade Marks for foreign money at any rate. This only made things worse. By November of 1923, one US Dollar could buy 4,210,500,000,000 Marks.  That is not a typo. The number is 4 trillion. Their money was devalued so fast that German workers had to go to the store right after getting paid. If they waited until the day's end, their money would be worthless. Basic items like stamps and loaves of bread cost billions of Marks. Germans had to figure their expenses in thousands of billions. That made it tough to get through the day if you lacked strong math skills. Some burned the old bills to provide heat. The Marks' value as a fuel had increased beyond its value as a currency.
That the German economy ever recovered is something of a miracle, but it did recover. They created a new currency called the Retenmark. Unlike the old Marks, the new Retenmark was backed by land and gold. This means the currency could be traded for gold or land at a fixed rate. This also meant that the government could only print as much money as they had land and gold to back it. That turned out to be a good thing. By December of 1923, the Retenmark was the official currency. The Germans cut 12 zeros from the prices of their products and it was business as usual. Though they still had a lot of issues to work out, the money was stable. That made life a lot more livable. So while you are out chasing after money, remember that money is little more than a promise, and that promises can be broken. What is one lesson that can be learned from the text? Support your answer with quotes from the text. Explain your quotes and your argument thoroughly.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One lesson that can be learned from the text is that inflation can have severe consequences on an economy and its people. The text provides a historical example of hyperinflation in Germany after World War I, where the value of their currency dropped rapidly, leading to skyrocketing prices of goods and services. As the text explains, "Since people usually don't start earning twice as much money out of nowhere, it can be a real problem" (paragraph 2).</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the text highlights the devastating effects of inflation on people's everyday lives, such as the need to buy basic items like bread and stamps for billions of Marks and the difficulty of figuring out expenses in thousands of billions. The text states, "Germans had to figure their expenses in thousands of billions. That made it tough to get through the day if you lacked strong math skills" (paragraph 5).</p><p></p><p>The text also suggests that a stable currency is crucial for a functioning economy and a better quality of life for people. The introduction of the new currency, the Retenmark, which was backed by land and gold and had a fixed rate of exchange, helped stabilize the German economy and restore confidence in their currency. The text notes, "By December of 1923, the Retenmark was the official currency. The Germans cut 12 zeros from the prices of their products and it was business as usual. Though they still had a lot of issues to work out, the money was stable. That made life a lot more livable" (paragraph 7).</p><p></p><p>In summary, the text highlights the negative consequences of inflation, the importance of a stable currency, and the need for governments to manage their economies carefully to prevent hyperinflation and its disastrous effects on the lives of their citizens.</p><br />

                            20. A mystory is a story based on a puzzling crime. Usually a mystery involves an objects disappearance or a person's untimely death. The main character, the detective, must use common sense and intelligence to solve the crime. He or the will search for clues and evidence that will answer the question "Whodunit? Clues can be items such as fingerprints or notes, or the witnessing of conversations or secret actions. Some of the other characters in a mystery are suspects, people who may have committed the crime. Although at first it appears that any one of the suspects may have committed the crime, the detective eventually narrows the possibilities Often the detective interviews suspects to learn who had the means, motive, and opportunity to commit the crime. He or she also seeks to learn alibis, suspects locations at the time the crime was committed Suspense and red herrings are common elements of mysteries. A writer must capture the reader's attention and make him or her want to read on to learn the solution to the mystery. Dark and dreary settings can help add suspense to a mystery. Red herrings, false or misleading clues, are sometimes included to direct a reader's suspicions away from the criminal toward other characters in the story who have a weak alibi or a strong motive. Eventually, however, the detective rules out such people and zeros in on the criminal. The solution to the mystery is revealed in the part of the story called the denouement.

                            21. Around a third of the ice shelves holding back huge glaciers in Antarctica are at risk of collapse if the world fails to take sufficient action on climate change, new projections have found.The ice shelves circling the continent are vulnerable to meltwater on their surface causing the ice to crack and disintegrate, a process known as hydrofracturing.Computer modelling by Ella Gilbert at the University of Reading, UK, and Christoph Kittel at the University of Liege, Belgium, showed that if the world warms by 4°C since pre-industrial levels, then 34 per cent of the continent’s ice shelves will have meltwater on their surface, a sign they are at risk of collapse.However, the figure falls to 18 per cent if temperature rises are checked at 2°C. The world is currently on track for a 2.9°C rise but, if implemented, climate plans and net zero goals would cut that to 2.1°C.“Warming to 2°C means half the ice shelf area is at risk of collapsing. That is the message: the less the warming the better,” says Gilbert.She and Kittel used a much higher resolution climate model than previous research, with grid squares 35 kilometers across rather than hundreds of kilometers across. It also more accurately represents cloud physics, which is vital as estimates of the area at risk of collapse hinge on how much ice loss is replaced by snowfall. The big difference between the 2°C and 4°C rise scenarios stems from melting outweighing increased snowfall in a 4°C warmer world.The Larsen C ice shelf on the east of the Antarctic Peninsula, where a huge iceberg broke off in 2017, was found to be one of the areas most at risk.“This study shows melting at the ice shelves’ surface will spread southwards to parts of the continent where huge reservoirs of inland ice may lose their protective barrier. If that happens, we can expect rapid increases in sea level rise along every coastline of our planet,” says Andrew Shepherd at the University of Leeds, UK, who wasn’t involved with the paper.The research doesn’t put a figure on how much sea level rise could occur if ice shelves collapsed and released the glaciers behind them. However, Gilbert says: “My gut feeling is for 4°C it could potentially contribute tens of centimeters if they did collapse.” Avoiding 10 centimeters of sea level rise should expose 10 million fewer people globally to flooding risks.Helene Seroussi at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, who wasn’t part of the research team, says the study’s big advance is using a higher resolution model. While the research identifies ice shelves that could be hydrofractured, Seroussi says further analysis of how individual ice shelves move – the “dynamical stress regime” – is needed to work out which ones will actually collapse.1. What impact of climate change is presented in the given article?2. According to the computer model made by Gilbert and Kittel, what will happen if the world warms by 4ºC?3. How will you elaborate the statement made by Gilbert, “the less the warming, the better”?4. What are the possible impacts to the environment and mankind if the ice shelves collapse?5.

A comparison-and-contrast pattern organizes idea based on how events, places, people, things, and Concept are similar to or different from one another. 2. to understand the text better,  knowing it's pattern of development is very important. 3. the purpose of comparison is not given as equal importance as the points of comparison. 4. "in A similar Fashion" is a signal word for contrasting. 5. There are many reasons why Unemployment seringnues to increase" is a thesis statement that showscomparison-and-contrast paltern.6. A pattern of development In reading refers to the particular strategy readers use to develop ideas whilereading7. "Freedom is a conceptthat needs to be understood" is a thesisstatement that does not show comparison-and-contrast pattern8. "Iphone 12 Pro Max has many features that make it stand outthe market" is a thesis statement that showscomparison-and-contrast pattem9. "Although Instagram and Twitter have significant similarities they also have striking differences" is a thesisstatement that shows comparison-and-contrast pattern10. Using a Venn Diagram is the best way to Illustrate the comparison-and-contrast paragraph11. Ideas in writing a comparison-and-contrast paragraph could be arranged side-by-sidewhich means all thedetails in first item will be described thoroughly followed by the descriptions of second Item12. The logical arrangement of Ideas is known as the pattern of paragraph13. In determining the pattern of development of ideas, note the signal words used.14. The signal words may help you identify the pattern of development, but it is more important that youunderstand the meaning of text15. "In the meantime" is a signal word for comparing,16. Various factors must be considered in identifying the effectiveness of a particular text.17. Knowing the components of a text or composition to further understand the properties of a well-written text isoptional.18. A composition can either be a paragraph or an essay. A paragraph is a group of Interrelated sentences thattalk about one main idea while an essay is a group of paragraphs thattalk about one central idea.19. In an essay, the body begins with the restatement of the thesis statement using a different structure andwording to uphold the language style.20. Cohesive devices are sentences that clarify and prove the main idea21. Unlike a paragraph, an essay has a more elaborate structure22. Unity is achieved when a composition contains several distinct ideas.23. Cohesion occurs when ideas are connected at the conceptual or Idea level. It can be seen through well-defended arguments and organized points.24. Coherence is the connection of ideas at the sentence level. It can be readily seen in a text through the smoothflow of the sentences and the connection of the ideas.25. The technical aspect of writing, also known as mechanics, should not be overlooked when writing. The use ofcontractions (eg, shouldn't) is encouraged and numbers from zero to ten should be spelled out while numbershigher than ten should be written In figures.​</h2><br />
