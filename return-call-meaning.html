 adapted from The Star and the Lily
 by Hamilton Wright Mabie
 At night the people met on the wide green—the ah-nung-o-kah—and watched the stars. One night they saw a star that shone brighter than all others, its location seemingly far away in the south, near a mountain peak. For many nights it was seen, until it was doubted by many that the star was as distant as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved the star to be only a short distance away. Warriors were sent to see what it was, and upon their return they said it appeared strange and somewhat like a bird. A committee was called at once to ascertain the meaning of the unusual phenomenon.
 By the time one moon had gone by, the mystery still remained unsolved. Then, one night a young warrior had a dream in which the star came and stood at his side, and said, "Young brave, I have come to dwell among you!" Then, the young man awoke, but on stepping out of his lodge he saw the star still in its accustomed place. At early dawn, every warrior was called to the council lodge. When all were gathered, the young warrior related his dream, and the council concluded that the star that had been seen in the south had fallen in love with mankind and wanted to live among them. So, the next night, five braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth and as they returned to the village, the star, with expanded wings, followed and hovered till the dawn of day.</a>

These restrictions have also been implemented within the Schengen Area. As a consequence, the European Union has issued a thirty-day ban on travels into the EU. This has left many international and mobile students stranded and in the impossibility to return to their home countries at the moment. The European Students’ Union and many of its members are supporting mobile and international students throughout the whole world by providing knowledge on how to return to their home countries. ESU urges governments to intervene by securing the repatriation within the EU and beyond its borders of all those who are willing to return by providing safe and cost efficient means to do so. Another serious concern for many students who decided to remain in their host countries or have not been able to repatriate yet is the issue of health insurance, especially for those who do not have a European Health Insurance Card. Therefore, we call for the automatic extension of all visas, including student visas, until the end of this pandemic. ​</a>

                                            B. Paraphrase the text below.There are many man-made causes of global warming. Pollution is one of the biggest man-made problems.Pollution comes in many shapes and sizes. Burning fossil fuels is one thing that causes pollution. Fossil fuelsare fuels made of organic matter such as coal, or oil. When fossil fuels are burned they give off a greenhousegas called CO2. Also, mining coal and oil allows methane to escape. Another major man-made cause ofGlobal Warming is population. More people mean more food, and more methods of transportation. Thattmeans more methane because there will be more burning of fossil fuels, and more agriculture. Anothersource of methane is manure. Because more food is needed to feed the population, we have to raise food.Animals like cows are a source of food which means more manure and hence more methane. Anotherproblem with the increasing population is transportation. More people mean more cars, and more cars meanmore pollution. Also, many people have more than one car. Also, the trees that convert our CO2 to oxygemare being cut down because we are using the land that we cut the trees down from as property for ounthomes and buildings. We are not replacing the tree, so we constantly taking advantage of our maturallresources and giving nothing back in return.​</a>

                            5. Which three pieces of evidence support the idea that the people do not know what the star is?
 adapted from The Star and the Lily
 by Hamilton Wright Mabie
 At night the people met on the wide green—the ah-nung-o-kah—and watched the stars. One night they saw a star that shone brighter than all others, its location seemingly far away in the south, near a mountain peak. For many nights it was seen, until it was doubted by many that the star was as distant as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved the star to be only a short distance away. Warriors were sent to see what it was, and upon their return they said it appeared strange and somewhat like a bird. A committee was called at once to ascertain the meaning of the unusual phenomenon.
 By the time one moon had gone by, the mystery still remained unsolved. Then, one night a young warrior had a dream in which the star came and stood at his side, and said, "Young brave, I have come to dwell among you!" Then, the young man awoke, but on stepping out of his lodge he saw the star still in its accustomed place. At early dawn, every warrior was called to the council lodge. When all were gathered, the young warrior related his dream, and the council concluded that the star that had been seen in the south had fallen in love with mankind and wanted to live among them. So, the next night, five braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth and as they returned to the village, the star, with expanded wings, followed and hovered till the dawn of day.</h2><br />

These restrictions have also been implemented within the Schengen Area. As a consequence, the European Union has issued a thirty-day ban on travels into the EU. This has left many international and mobile students stranded and in the impossibility to return to their home countries at the moment. The European Students’ Union and many of its members are supporting mobile and international students throughout the whole world by providing knowledge on how to return to their home countries. ESU urges governments to intervene by securing the repatriation within the EU and beyond its borders of all those who are willing to return by providing safe and cost efficient means to do so. Another serious concern for many students who decided to remain in their host countries or have not been able to repatriate yet is the issue of health insurance, especially for those who do not have a European Health Insurance Card. Therefore, we call for the automatic extension of all visas, including student visas, until the end of this pandemic. ​</h2><br />

Pollution is one of the biggest man-made problems.Pollution comes in many shapes and sizes. Burning fossil fuels is one thing that causes pollution. Fossil fuelsare fuels made of organic matter such as coal, or oil. When fossil fuels are burned they give off a greenhousegas called CO2. Also, mining coal and oil allows methane to escape. Another major man-made cause ofGlobal Warming is population. More people mean more food, and more methods of transportation. Thattmeans more methane because there will be more burning of fossil fuels, and more agriculture. Anothersource of methane is manure. Because more food is needed to feed the population, we have to raise food.Animals like cows are a source of food which means more manure and hence more methane. Anotherproblem with the increasing population is transportation. More people mean more cars, and more cars meanmore pollution. Also, many people have more than one car. Also, the trees that convert our CO2 to oxygemare being cut down because we are using the land that we cut the trees down from as property for ounthomes and buildings. We are not replacing the tree, so we constantly taking advantage of our maturallresources and giving nothing back in return.​</h2><br />
