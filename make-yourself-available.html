                        <p>I informed them of my schedule and promised to make myself available to them as much as possible. I tell my family and friends that "I'm here if you need me".  I rise to the occasion when asked. I thought it was selfish of me not to be available for those who are already on my calendar. Making myself available entails exactly that: making yourself available. If I say, "I'm always available for you," I'm putting myself at their disposal. But even as a selfless person, this is not a wise decision. Remember to always leave room for the unexpected.</p><p></p><p>(This is exactly 100 words.)</p><br />

2. Do you consider Jesus as the only "source" to which you turn in order to satisfy your spiritual thirst, or do you look for other "sources"?
3. How do you make yourself available to others the way Jesus does, so as to become a channel of his grace and love?</h2><br />
                        <p>1. There are different types of thirst that people can experience in their lives, such as physical thirst, emotional thirst, and spiritual thirst. People may try to satisfy these thirsts in various ways, such as by drinking water or other fluids to quench physical thirst, seeking support and connection from others to address emotional thirst, or seeking spiritual practices and beliefs to address spiritual thirst.</p><p></p><p>2. Many Christians believe that Jesus is the only source that can truly satisfy their spiritual thirst. They believe that Jesus offers living water that can quench their deepest spiritual thirst and provide them with eternal life. However, some people may also seek spiritual fulfillment through other sources, such as meditation, mindfulness, or other religious or spiritual practices.</p><p></p><p>3. To make oneself available to others in the way that Jesus does, one can practice empathy, compassion, and selflessness. This may involve actively listening to others, seeking to understand their needs and concerns, and offering help and support when possible. It can also involve treating others with respect and kindness, even in difficult or challenging situations. By following Jesus' example of love and service, individuals can become channels of his grace and love to others.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Emerging trends in education are increasingly moving towards learner-centered approaches. In these, learning becomes an active process of discovery and participation based on self-motivation rather than on more passive acquaintance of facts and rules (Sfard, 1998). The role of the teacher is coming more to be seen as mentor or guide, facilitating and playing an essential role in this process. From this perspective, learning can be considered as a dynamic process in which the learner actively "constructs" new knowledge as he or she is engaged and immersed in a learning activity (Papert, 1993). The theory of constructivism is at the core of the movement to shift the center of instruction away from delivery in order to allow the leamer to actively direct and choose a personal learning path. Jonassen (1998) claims that designers committed to designing and implementing constructivist learning environments need an appropriate set of design tools and methods which are consistent with the fundamental assumptions of those environments for analyzing learning outcomes and designing constructivist learning environments.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>CARRY </strong><strong>ON </strong><strong>LEARNING.</strong><br />

Some Tips on how to be a Wise Consumer Gather correct and sufficient information-get as much information by reading critically the details on the nutritional quality of the food. Be aware that being knowledgeable of the laws will protect you as a consumer. 2. Compare and contrast details of available products - compare and contrast the products and services available before you purchase. Judge for yourself which among the products are most effective. You can use the questions in assessing the health information as your initial guide. 3. Inquire for more and review if possible - ask direct questions from sales personnel if there are things about the product that are not clear to you before buying it. Clarifying things will make you more confident as a consumer. You can also get some information from other consumers regarding the product.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>With the explosion of digital technologies, companies are sweeping up vast quantities of data about consumers’ activities, both online and off. Feeding this trend are new smart, connected products—from fitness trackers to home systems—that gather and transmit detailed information.</p><p>Though some companies are open about their data practices, most prefer to keep consumers in the dark, choose control over sharing, and ask for forgiveness rather than permission. It’s also not unusual for companies to quietly collect personal data they have no immediate use for, reasoning that it might be valuable someday.</p><p>As current and former executives at frog, a firm that helps clients create products and services that leverage users’ personal data, we believe this shrouded approach to data gathering is shortsighted. Having free use of customer data may confer near-term advantages. But our research shows that consumers are aware that they’re under surveillance—even though they may be poorly informed about the specific types of data collected about them—and are deeply anxious about how their personal information may be used.</p><p>In a future in which customer data will be a growing source of competitive advantage, gaining consumers’ confidence will be key. Companies that are transparent about the information they gather, give customers control of their personal data, and offer fair value in return for it will be trusted and will earn ongoing and even expanded access. Those that conceal how they use personal data and fail to provide value for it stand to lose customers’ goodwill—and their business.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it Helps</p><br />
