                                            The Sleeping Beauty
 In a palace many years ago, the most beautiful princess was born to king and 
 queen. They named her Rosamond and gave a party during her baptism. All the wise 
 women were invited except the thirteenth wise woman. 
 On the day of the party, the thirteenth wise woman came. She was so angry for 
 she did not have a golden plate. She left the palace hurriedly and said, “Rosamond 
 will not die of hurting her finger with a spindle but she will sleep for a hundred years 
 instead.”
 The king ordered his servants to burn all spindles in the palace. 
 Rosamond grew and become the loveliest princess in the kingdom. On her 
 fifteenth birthday, she went around the palace . She encountered in one of the rooms 
 and saw a woman with spindle. She borrowed the spindle and was wounded. 
 Immediately, she fell into a deep sleep. All the people in the kingdom went asleep, 
 too, including the animals. 
 After a hundred years, a handsome young prince came to the palace. He was 
 surprised of the thick vines that covered the palace. He went inside and saw the lovely 
 sleeping princess. For him, she was the most beautiful princess he ever saw. He fell in 
 love with an instant. He knelt down and kissed her. 
 The princess woke up. All the people and animals woke up,too.

THE BIRTHDAY SURPRISEToday is my birthday and I am so excited! I wake up early and jump out of bed as quick as a flash. I zoom down the stairs and run into the lounge room where I see a pile of presents in the middle of the floor. There is also an enormous chocolate cake on the kitchen bench. I spend my morning unwrapping presents with my parents. I got a new brand of bike and a really cool school bag. In the afternoon my friends all arrive for my birthday party. There is a clown, a jumping castle and lots of party food. We play lots of fun games like pass the parcel, pin the tail on the donkey and musical chairs. Everyone is laughing and having a great time. At the end of the party I get to hand out party bags to all my friends as they leave. That night my parents cook my favorite food, fried chicken, spaghetti, and salad and then we have left over birthday cake for dessert. I finally fall into bed with an enormous smile on my face. I am so exhausted but I've had the best day ever and I can't wait for my birthday next year!

                            8. The Sleeping Beauty
 In a palace many years ago, the most beautiful princess was born to king and 
 queen. They named her Rosamond and gave a party during her baptism. All the wise 
 women were invited except the thirteenth wise woman. 
 On the day of the party, the thirteenth wise woman came. She was so angry for 
 she did not have a golden plate. She left the palace hurriedly and said, “Rosamond 
 will not die of hurting her finger with a spindle but she will sleep for a hundred years 
 instead.”
 The king ordered his servants to burn all spindles in the palace. 
 Rosamond grew and become the loveliest princess in the kingdom. On her 
 fifteenth birthday, she went around the palace . She encountered in one of the rooms 
 and saw a woman with spindle. She borrowed the spindle and was wounded. 
 Immediately, she fell into a deep sleep. All the people in the kingdom went asleep, 
 too, including the animals. 
 After a hundred years, a handsome young prince came to the palace. He was 
 surprised of the thick vines that covered the palace. He went inside and saw the lovely 
 sleeping princess. For him, she was the most beautiful princess he ever saw. He fell in 
 love with an instant. He knelt down and kissed her. 
 The princess woke up. All the people and animals woke up,too.

THE BIRTHDAY SURPRISEToday is my birthday and I am so excited! I wake up early and jump out of bed as quick as a flash. I zoom down the stairs and run into the lounge room where I see a pile of presents in the middle of the floor. There is also an enormous chocolate cake on the kitchen bench. I spend my morning unwrapping presents with my parents. I got a new brand of bike and a really cool school bag. In the afternoon my friends all arrive for my birthday party. There is a clown, a jumping castle and lots of party food. We play lots of fun games like pass the parcel, pin the tail on the donkey and musical chairs. Everyone is laughing and having a great time. At the end of the party I get to hand out party bags to all my friends as they leave. That night my parents cook my favorite food, fried chicken, spaghetti, and salad and then we have left over birthday cake for dessert. I finally fall into bed with an enormous smile on my face. I am so exhausted but I've had the best day ever and I can't wait for my birthday next year!
