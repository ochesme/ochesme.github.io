                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social work is the helping profession.</p><p>￼</p><p>The primary mission of the social work profession is to enhance human well-being and help meet basic and complex needs of all people, with a particular focus on those who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty. If you’re looking for a career with meaning, action, diversity, satisfaction, and a variety of options, consider social work.</p><p>Social work is different from other professions, because we focus both on the person and their environment. Social workers deal with the external factors that impact a person's situation and outlook. And we create opportunities for assessment and intervention, to help clients and communities cope effectively with their reality and change that reality when necessary. Social workers help clients deal not only with how they feel about a situation but also with what they can do about it.</p><p>In thousands of ways, social workers help people of every age and background, all across the country. The most well-known aspect of the social work profession is providing direct services or therapy directly to clients. We help guide people to critical resources and counsel them on life-changing decisions. We also advocate for change to improve social conditions and strengthen the social net.</p><p>There are more than 600,000 professional social workers in the United States, and we all either have a BSW, MSW or a DSW/PhD in Social Work. There are more clinically trained social workers than clinically trained psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses combined.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        "Weighing the Pros and Cons: Living and Working Abroad vs Staying in the Philippines"<p></p><p>(Introduction)</p><p>Living and working abroad can be a thrilling and exciting experience, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. On the other hand, staying and working in one's own country can offer a sense of comfort and familiarity. In this paper, I will discuss the pros and cons of living and working abroad and staying and working in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>(Body Paragraph 1)</p><p>One of the main advantages of living and working abroad is the opportunity to gain international experience and exposure. This can be beneficial for personal and professional growth, as well as for building a diverse and global network of contacts. Additionally, living and working abroad can also open up opportunities for higher pay and better benefits.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also some downsides to living and working abroad. These include homesickness, culture shock, and language barriers. It can also be difficult to maintain relationships with family and friends who are back home. Additionally, the cost of living in some foreign countries can be quite high, making it more difficult to save money.</p><p></p><p>(Body Paragraph 2)</p><p>On the other hand, staying and working in the Philippines has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. One of the main advantages is the ability to be close to family and friends, which can be a great source of support and comfort. Additionally, the cost of living in the Philippines is generally lower than in many other countries, which can make it easier to save money.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also some downsides to staying and working in the Philippines. These include limited opportunities for professional growth and advancement, as well as lower pay and benefits compared to some other countries. Additionally, the Philippines can also be prone to natural disasters, which can be a source of stress and uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>(Conclusion)</p><p>In conclusion, both living and working abroad and staying and working in the Philippines have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the decision of whether to live and work abroad or to stay and work in the Philippines will depend on an individual's personal preferences and priorities. It's important to weigh the pros and cons and consider the long-term implications before making a decision.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Renaissance art</strong>,  Most people understand that if a painting or sculpture is made in Europe between <strong>1300 and 1600</strong>, it's likely a Renaissance work. And, if it's a European work made between <strong>1600 and 1750</strong>, then it's <strong>Baroque. </strong><strong>John Vanderlyn (1775 – 1852) </strong>- it is because his painting was initially considered too sexual for display in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  "Although nudity in art was publicly protested by Americans, Vanderlyn observed that they would pay to see pictures of which they disapproved."<p><strong>#UlloriaqEmpire</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Prior to the late early 1900s, courtship was a much more private, unemotional affair. Women would meet with several men, with her parents present, to whittle the pickings down to the most suitable match for marriage, which heavily relied on factors such as financial and social status.</p><p></p><p>2. Because of its quiet sound, the jaw harp in Oceania is a personal instrument, generally played for entertainment but also used, in many places, for courting or love magic.</p><p></p><p>3.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The primary mission of the social work profession is to enhance human well-being and help meet basic and complex needs of all people, with a particular focus on those who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty. If you’re looking for a career with meaning, action, diversity, satisfaction, and a variety of options, consider social work.</p><p></p><p>Social work is different from other professions, because we focus both on the person and their environment. Social workers deal with the external factors that impact a person's situation and outlook. And we create opportunities for assessment and intervention, to help clients and communities cope effectively with their reality and change that reality when necessary. Social workers help clients deal not only with how they feel about a situation but also with what they can do about it.</p><p></p><p>In thousands of ways, social workers help people of every age and background, all across the country. The most well-known aspect of the social work profession is providing direct services or therapy directly to clients. We help guide people to critical resources and counsel them on life-changing decisions. We also advocate for change to improve social conditions and strengthen the social net.</p><p></p><p>There are more than 600,000 professional social workers in the United States, and we all either have a BSW, MSW or a DSW/PhD in Social Work. There are more clinically trained social workers than clinically trained psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses combined.</p><br />
