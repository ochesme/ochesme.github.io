                                            What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</a>

                            8. What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</h2><br />

This is the lot of the oneinstead of amassing for God."ACTIVITYDIRECTIONS: Answer briefly the following question.1. What is the meaning of the Parable of the Rich Fool?2. What did the rich man do with his abundant harvest?3. What did God say to the rich man?4. In your opinion, what virtues must the rich man develop?5. What is the lesson of the parable?Demar​</h2><br />
                        1.) Answer = The Parable of the Rich Fool is a parable of Jesus which appears in Luke 12:16–21. It depicts the futility of the belief that wealth can secure prosperity or a good life.<br />2.) Answer = There are 18 parables in the Gospel of Luke. One of the shortest ones contains one of the most powerful messages. It’s about the rich man who had a magnificent harvest. He faced a conundrum: “What shall I do with this fantastic harvest? My barns will never hold all of this since they still have some of last year’s harvest.” His solution makes sense and, in fact, helps him plan for what he anticipates will be big harvests for years to come.<br /><br />“I’ll tear down my old barns and build new bigger ones so I have plenty of storage space for this harvest.” So far so good. But he forgets a most basic truth: he is not governor of his time or his lifespan. He envisions his new barns bursting with grain and exclaims to himself, “You have so many good things stored up for many years that you can rest, eat, drink, and be merry!”<br /><br />God is surely not condemning this man’s hard work and dedication. God is not condemning wealth or riches that the man acquired. Sometimes we can get that impression from the Scriptures. But if you look at the great variety of saints whose lives we celebrate, many were poor and had little. At the same time, there have been kings and queens who reached a high degree of sanctity.<br />3.) Answer =  Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."<br />5.) Answer = Hence, this parable taught us a moral lesson in three ways: God can change time. God has power over life, death, resurrection, and no other can have this power. Humans have no power, and they should put their faith only in God<br />
