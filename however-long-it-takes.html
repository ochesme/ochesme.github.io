individuals came to you and asked you how far is the nearest school from your house (assume that the school
is 1000 m away from your position). These individuals asked how long will it take them to reach it However,
you noticed that the first individual is using a motorcycle, the second uses an ordinary bicycle and the last
individual is just walking. (a) Who among them will reach the school the fastest and the slowest? Explain

However, a geologist found fossils of the same type of organism on both continents. Millions of years ago, when this type of organism was alive, we know it lived in only one place. The geologist is using the fossils as evidence to argue that the two continents used to be touching.

                                            12.What grammatical signal is appropriate to complete the paragraph below? Some teachers do not allow students to use cellphones during classes. However, using them in class has advantages. Cellphones are useful for students in searching definitions and relevant information They can check pronunciations and browse pictures to fully understand concepts. Another advantage is their cellphones make mote- taking more convenient. Students don't need to take down long notes from the board, and can just take photos and record the teacher's discussions instead. Furthermore, it also serves as an alternative calculator in Math subjects.. teachers view cellphones as a distraction to students, they are still very useful. Therefore, with proper supervision and monitoring, cellphones can be very beneficial to students during classes.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>we are being undermined by a coworker. Personally, I prefer outright hostility to undermining because at least it’s overt and, thus, easier to address. Undermining, on the other hand, is subtle. It is not readily apparent like bullying or harassment. Because of the subversive nature of undermining, it is harder to spot and more difficult to report.</p><p></p><p>Being sabotaged in this way may make you question if you’re just being too sensitive or if you’re imagining things. That is the evil genius of one who undermines: The situation can be tricky to identify and tough to deal with. So, how do you tell if your colleague is trying to undermine you, and what can you do about it? This month’s column will help answer those questions, starting with how to spot people who undermine you.</p><p></p><br />

However, using them in class has advantages. Cellphones are useful for students in searching definitions and relevant information. They can check pronunciations and brotese pictures to fully understand concepts. Another advantage is the cellphones make note-taking more convenient. Students don't need to take down long notes from the board and can just take photos and record the teacher's discussions instead Furthermore, it also serves as an alternative calculator in Math subjects teachers view cellphones as a distraction to students, they are still very useful Therefore, with proper supervision and morntoring cellphones can be very beneficial to bedents during classes A Although B.

However, using them in class has advantages. Cellphones are useful for students in searching definitions and relevant information They can check pronunciations and browse pictures to fully understand concepts. Another advantage is their cellphones make mote- taking more convenient. Students don't need to take down long notes from the board, and can just take photos and record the teacher's discussions instead. Furthermore, it also serves as an alternative calculator in Math subjects.. teachers view cellphones as a distraction to students, they are still very useful. Therefore, with proper supervision and monitoring, cellphones can be very beneficial to students during classes.​</h2><br />

                        First and foremost, it requires strong and resilient health systems, in particular primary care, to facilitate detection of disease outbreaks, provide essential care, and support deployment of vaccines and other medical countermeasures. Second, it requires surveillance systems and laboratory capacity to detect both human and zoonotic disease outbreaks. Third, mechanisms are needed for coordination across sectors for prevention and preparedness. Fourth, preparedness requires legal frameworks and regulatory instruments to support both outbreak prevention and the deployment of countermeasures. Fifth, there is a need for well-functioning supply-chains as well as adequate stockpiles of essential goods and equipment. <p></p><br />
