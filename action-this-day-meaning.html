Conversation 1
Amanda: I think action films are a waste of money. They have a lot of races and explosions and things like that
but they don't have interesting stories.
Bob: (13)
Action films are just action, without good stories.

In my opinion, the action is just part of the story.

Amanda: (17)
People often think that things were better when they were
young, Most children get enough exercise.

Chelsea: I think school uniforms are a good idea. When children are all dressed the same, no one can feel betten
or worse than other kids because of how they're dressed.

Kids sometimes include or exclude other kids based on the
clothing. If the clothing is all the same, that won't happen

                                            So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</a>

Write the correct letter on the space provided before the number. a.Plotb.Characterc.Settingd.Point of viewe.Conflictf.Rising Actiong.Resolutionh.Climaxi.Expositionj.Falling Action____ 1. A piece of literature has to have at least one character, which can be a person, an object, or an animal.____ 2. It is defined as the sequence of events that occurs from the first line to the last.____ 3. The central struggle that motivates the characters and leads to the climax. ____ 4. This is the "peak" of the plot where all the tension of the rising action finally comes to a head, the characters finally have to face and solve the major conflict.____ 5. This is the very beginning of a story. During the beginning, authors usually introduce the major characters and settings to the reader.____ 6. It is the time and location where the story takes place, the periods, geographic locations, cultural contexts, immediate surroundings, weather, times of day, or times of year in the story.____ 7. It is literally everything that happens in a story that leads up to the climax of the plot.____ 8. It is everything that happens after the book's climax but before the resolution. This is where writers tie up any loose ends and start bringing the book's action to a close.____ 9. It is the position of the narrator in relationship to the plot of a piece of literature, it is the perspective from which the story is told.____10. This is the conclusion of a story. But just because it's called conclusion, doesn't mean every single issue is resolved happily—or even satisfactorily. ​</a>

                            17. So, what do you notice with each pair in every item? If you say that they show relationships, then you are correct The term that means "word relationships" is called Analogy. It is like a word puzzle. It always contains two pairs of words. It can be abbreviated like stallion: mare: man: woman. The single colon (3) represents the phrase "is to", and the double colon (3) represents the word "as". Thus, it is read a stallion is to a mare as a man is to a woman Take a look again at the pairs of words in the task you have answered previously. In item number 1, which is night is to day as happy is to sad, what do you think is the relationship of the paired words? If you say that the pairs show an opposite relationship, then you are correct because night is the opposite of day and happy is also the opposite of sad. And that type of analogy is called Antonyms. What about item number 2? Yes, the pairs show a similar relationship or have the same meaning because husband and spouse have the same meaning as well as the second paired words which are baby and infant. It is called Synonyms. Let's proceed to item number 3. What do you observe? Right! The analogies contain words that are the causes, or the sources of some actions or conditions which are cold and hot and the other words that are the effects, or the results or consequences which are shiver and sweat. And that type is called Cause and Effect.translate in tagalog ​</h2><br />

It is defined as the sequence of events that occurs from the first line to the last.____ 3. The central struggle that motivates the characters and leads to the climax. ____ 4. This is the "peak" of the plot where all the tension of the rising action finally comes to a head, the characters finally have to face and solve the major conflict.____ 5. This is the very beginning of a story. During the beginning, authors usually introduce the major characters and settings to the reader.____ 6. It is the time and location where the story takes place, the periods, geographic locations, cultural contexts, immediate surroundings, weather, times of day, or times of year in the story.____ 7. It is literally everything that happens in a story that leads up to the climax of the plot.____ 8. It is everything that happens after the book's climax but before the resolution. This is where writers tie up any loose ends and start bringing the book's action to a close.____ 9. It is the position of the narrator in relationship to the plot of a piece of literature, it is the perspective from which the story is told.____10. This is the conclusion of a story.
