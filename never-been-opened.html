                                            In a queer fittle bamboo house in front of a big garden hved a man and his wife all alone. They had always been kind and good to everyone, but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that they were growing old, they believed that they must always live alone. In the garden near their house, this couple grew fine white squash, and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first time in many seasons they had no vegetables. Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally, one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable, but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that they decided to eat it. They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they started to open it when a voice cried out from within, "Please be careful that you do not hurt me." The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside was a nice baby boy [1] He could already stand alone and could talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed. 1. squash is the only food that the couple eats every day. from this statement tell the setting of the story and the source of income of the people? 2. what negative trait does the couple possessed? 3. if we are to analyze the couples characters they were not as greedy as day were when they are still poor what do you think have changed their behavior? 4. what do you think will happen if the couple became contented with that they had? 5. what lesson did the story taught us? pls give me correct answer​</a>

                                            “We are confronted with what is perhaps the most challenging chapter in contemporary Philippine history. COVID-19 continues to cripple the world in ways that seemed unimaginable, yet are now painfully unfolding right before our very eyes. Even economies of the world perceived to be strong and stable have been shocked, and shaken, by this disease. COVID-19's aftermath is a reality to be feared as well. Amidst all the chaos and confusion, amidst the seemingly gloomy search for an antidote, and despite the resounding call for national solidarity and cooperation, there are those who still manage to malign the integrity and commitment of the Senate in advancing the country and the people's ultimate good. The Senate has been accused of doing nothing, of failing to rise and serve the people at a time when they needed their leaders the most. Such statements are unjust and disheartening, Mr. President. If I alone had been the target of these attacks, Mr. President, I should not take a moment of the Senate's valuable time today, but I believe that other Senators who have been unjustly and wilfully assailed, hold the same attitude upon this that I do. The reckless provocations, fake news, most often for pettiest and personal reasons - not having to do whatsoever with the role of a Senator in the current Coronavirus crisis- should never be regarded as new normal. We should never allow purveyors of fake news and vested interest to desecrate the Senate as an institution. The Philippine Senate holds the distinction of remaining open, with our adoption of hybrid proceedings by virtue of P.S. Reso. No. 372, while other legislatures in other countries - with all due respect, China, Madagascar, Czech Republic, Malaysia, and Mexico - have remained closed. I rise today, in recognition of the efforts and sacrifices made by our colleagues here in the midst of the pandemic. Three of our colleagues were affected Covid 19 and 20 staff were tested positive. Lastly, I rise today, to give a highlight of the accomplishments of our colleagues, starting with the landmark measure that laid down the framework for the recovery and rehabilitation of the country.”--- Senator Francis Tolentino , May 6,2020.Honesty:Use of Language:Citation:Speech goals:Description/Interpretation;Pa helps po please...​</a>

                                            The Buntun bridge spans the Cagayan River. It is 1,369 m long and said to be the longest river bridge in the country. It was opened in 1947 and has been known as the gateway to the City of Tuguegarao.The bridge has never been flooded by the river but it almost did when typhoons Ondoy and Juan hit the city. One of the reasons why it still stands magnificently until today because of its structures that are made of congruent triangles. In the figure at the right, it is given that ED = RB and ED// RB.

                                            The Story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears By:Robert Southey Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She went for a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house. She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in. At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry. She tasted the porridge from the first bowl. "This porridge is too hot)" she exclaimed. So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl. "This porridge is too cold," she said. So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge. "Ahhh, this porridge is just right," she said happily and she ate it all up. After she'd eaten the three bears' breakfasts, she decided she was feeling a little tired. So, she walked into the living room where she saw three chairs. Goldilocks sat in the first chair to rest. "This chair is too bigl" she exclaimed. So she sat in the second chair. "This chair is too big, tool" she whined. So she tried the last and smallest chair. "Ahhh, this chair is just right," she sighed. But just as she settled down into the chair to rest, it broke into pieces! Goldilocks and the Three Bears: sleeping-goldilocks .Goldilocks was very tired by this time, she went upstairs to the bedroom. She lay down in the first bed, but it was too hard. Then she lay in the second bed, but it was too soft. Then she lay down in the third bed and it was just right. Goldilocks fell asleep. As she was sleeping, the three bears came home. "Someone's been eating my porridge," growled the Papa bear. " "Someone's been eating my porridge," said the Mama bear. "Someone's been eating my porridge and they ate it all up!" cried the Baby bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair," growled the Papa bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair," said the Mama bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair and they've broken it to pleces," cried the Baby bear They decided to look around some more and when they got upstairs to the bedroom, Papa bear growled, "Someone's been sleeping in my bed." "Someone's been sleeping in my bed, too" said the Mama bear. "Someone's been sleeping in my bed and she's still there!" exclaimed the Baby bear. Just then, Goldilocks woke up. She saw the three bears. She screamed, "Help!" And she jumped up and ran out of the room. Goldilocks ran down the stalrs, opened the door, and ran away into the forest. She never returned to the home of the three bears. THE END CHARACTERS : SETTINGS: RISING ACTION: CLIMAX : RESOLUTION:​ ​</a>

They had always been kind and good to everyone, but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that they were growing old they believed that they must always live alone.In the garden near their house this couple grew fine white squash, and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first time in many seasons they had no vegetables.Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally, one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable, but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that they decided to eat it.They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they started to open it when a voice cried out from within, “Please be careful that you do not hurt me.”The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside was a nice baby boy. He could already stand alone and could talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed.Presently the woman went to the spring for a jar of water, and when she had brought it she spread a mat on the floor and began to bathe the baby. As the drops of water fell off his body, they were immediately changed to gold, so that when the bath was finished gold pieces covered the mat. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever.The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.pa answer kailangan kanapo kasi?​</a>

                            18. “We are confronted with what is perhaps the most challenging chapter in contemporary Philippine history. COVID-19 continues to cripple the world in ways that seemed unimaginable, yet are now painfully unfolding right before our very eyes. Even economies of the world perceived to be strong and stable have been shocked, and shaken, by this disease. COVID-19's aftermath is a reality to be feared as well. Amidst all the chaos and confusion, amidst the seemingly gloomy search for an antidote, and despite the resounding call for national solidarity and cooperation, there are those who still manage to malign the integrity and commitment of the Senate in advancing the country and the people's ultimate good. The Senate has been accused of doing nothing, of failing to rise and serve the people at a time when they needed their leaders the most. Such statements are unjust and disheartening, Mr. President. If I alone had been the target of these attacks, Mr. President, I should not take a moment of the Senate's valuable time today, but I believe that other Senators who have been unjustly and wilfully assailed, hold the same attitude upon this that I do. The reckless provocations, fake news, most often for pettiest and personal reasons - not having to do whatsoever with the role of a Senator in the current Coronavirus crisis- should never be regarded as new normal. We should never allow purveyors of fake news and vested interest to desecrate the Senate as an institution. The Philippine Senate holds the distinction of remaining open, with our adoption of hybrid proceedings by virtue of P.S. Reso. No. 372, while other legislatures in other countries - with all due respect, China, Madagascar, Czech Republic, Malaysia, and Mexico - have remained closed. I rise today, in recognition of the efforts and sacrifices made by our colleagues here in the midst of the pandemic. Three of our colleagues were affected Covid 19 and 20 staff were tested positive.

                            25. The Story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears By:Robert Southey Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She went for a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house. She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in. At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry. She tasted the porridge from the first bowl. "This porridge is too hot)" she exclaimed. So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl. "This porridge is too cold," she said. So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge. "Ahhh, this porridge is just right," she said happily and she ate it all up. After she'd eaten the three bears' breakfasts, she decided she was feeling a little tired. So, she walked into the living room where she saw three chairs. Goldilocks sat in the first chair to rest. "This chair is too bigl" she exclaimed. So she sat in the second chair. "This chair is too big, tool" she whined. So she tried the last and smallest chair. "Ahhh, this chair is just right," she sighed. But just as she settled down into the chair to rest, it broke into pieces! Goldilocks and the Three Bears: sleeping-goldilocks .Goldilocks was very tired by this time, she went upstairs to the bedroom. She lay down in the first bed, but it was too hard. Then she lay in the second bed, but it was too soft. Then she lay down in the third bed and it was just right. Goldilocks fell asleep. As she was sleeping, the three bears came home. "Someone's been eating my porridge," growled the Papa bear. " "Someone's been eating my porridge," said the Mama bear. "Someone's been eating my porridge and they ate it all up!" cried the Baby bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair," growled the Papa bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair," said the Mama bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair and they've broken it to pleces," cried the Baby bear They decided to look around some more and when they got upstairs to the bedroom, Papa bear growled, "Someone's been sleeping in my bed." "Someone's been sleeping in my bed, too" said the Mama bear. "Someone's been sleeping in my bed and she's still there!" exclaimed the Baby bear. Just then, Goldilocks woke up. She saw the three bears. She screamed, "Help!" And she jumped up and ran out of the room. Goldilocks ran down the stalrs, opened the door, and ran away into the forest. She never returned to the home of the three bears. THE END CHARACTERS : SETTINGS: RISING ACTION: CLIMAX : RESOLUTION:​ ​</h2><br />

They had always been kind and good to everyone, but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that they were growing old they believed that they must always live alone.In the garden near their house this couple grew fine white squash, and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first time in many seasons they had no vegetables.Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally, one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable, but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that they decided to eat it.They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they started to open it when a voice cried out from within, “Please be careful that you do not hurt me.”The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside was a nice baby boy. He could already stand alone and could talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed.Presently the woman went to the spring for a jar of water, and when she had brought it she spread a mat on the floor and began to bathe the baby. As the drops of water fell off his body, they were immediately changed to gold, so that when the bath was finished gold pieces covered the mat. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever.The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.pa answer kailangan kanapo kasi?​</h2><br />

                            30. Dear Students of Model School, Hello! Hope you are all doing well! I am manager of the STATE BANK. Your Mum and Dad have been telling you all about the benefits of saving up. So it would be an awesome idea to open a bank account for yourself. I think you might try this. But if you still not very sure about how banks work and you've never been inside a bank before. So next week our team is going to conduct an awareness camp at your school to explain all about an account. So all of you, could you please think of some questions that you should ask our team. I would really appreciate if you write all your questions before. Thanks students to all your interest!HELP PLSMAKE A QUESTION THAT START WITH WHO​</h2><br />
