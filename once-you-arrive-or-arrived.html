                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My thoughts about this is <strong>NO</strong>. There are a lot of things to consider and not all can be adjusted easily. We can have little by little step to proceed to the usual living though it will be troublesome for everything to come back. We are not yet sure if <strong>everything</strong> will be fine not until we are currently in the serious and actual situation but we have high hopes that it will. Another is that, we cant avoid to loose a thing so worse case is when we're back to normal,  it could be some things and not everthing. </p><p></p><br />

The mountain climbers passed by the torn and frozen remains of a tent set earlier. The guides arrived firstly at the little sloping area found before the final camp. The two climbers followed next. Soon they arrived at midday. Their first task was to improve the campsite. Chipping out a platform in the ice-bound rock was perhaps the hardest work they had to do.

Her supervisor noticed that over the last month grace has been arriving half an hour late and is often on the phone quarreling with her aunt. The supervisor has given grace two warnings. One day grace arrives 20 minutes late due to traffic. When she arrives she sees her supervisor helping a customer once the customer departs the supervisor informs grace that she will no longer need grace to work for her. She needs someone who can be on time and response to customer needs. questions.... 1.what happened in the scenario and why? 2.Do you think the supervisor made the right decision to fired grace? 3.Is it important to keep work and family life seperate? how does one do this. 4.What could have grace done differently so that she would not have lost her job? 5.What behaviors led grace to losing her job?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. In the senario, Grace was fired due to her being late at work.</p><p></p><p>2. At first I think it wasn't the right desision to fire a employee due to being late. But maybe it may be the right decision because it will be very hard to not be present at a short period of time at work. So, I think it is a so-so.</p><p></p><p>3. I think it is important to seperate work and family because it may conflict with the work.</p><p></p><p>4. I think she should not be late at work by not stressing herself the day before work and try to be early and relaxfully sleep so that she may not be late. As mentioned in the story, she has to take one hour to reach her work so that may be caused by not sleeping early as I said before.</p><p></p><p>5. The behaviors that led Grace to be fired because she is late again. I think she was stress because of quarelling with her aunt on the phone so that is why she is late.</p><p></p><br />
