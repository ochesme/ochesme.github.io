                                            Hi can you identify the figure of speech here 
In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;
this Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
And if I need to suffer, 
for You to be glorified, 
I pray that I’ll be reminded 
of how good you are
That this is just a phase, 
and you understand my pain
so I will seek and shout for You
even louder.
You split the sea, so I could walk right through it.
All my fears were drowned in perfect love.
You rescued me so I could stand and sing.
I am a child of God.
You don’t see the wind but you know it’s there. 
You don’t see air but you know it’s there. 
Faith is like that. 
You don’t need to see God but you know he’s there.
Jesus Christ
You are my one desire
Lord hear my only cry
To know You all my life.
I will give you 25 pts.... please this is my project please</a>

                            8. We broke up a month ago Your friends are mine, you know, I know You've moved on, found someone new One more girl who brings out the better in you And I thought my heart was detached From all the sunlight of our past But she's so sweet, she's so pretty Does she mean you forgot about me? - [Chorus] Oh, I hope you're happy But not like how you were with me I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go So find someone great, but don't find no one better I hope you're happy, but don't be happier - [Verse 2] And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen? And promised three words you know you'll never meet Remember when I believed You meant it when you said it first to me? And now I'm pickin' her apart Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart But she's beautiful, she looks kind She probably gives you butterflies - [Chorus] I hope you're happy But not like how you were with me I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go So find someone great, but don't find no one better I hope you're happy I wish you all the best, really Say you love her, baby Just not like you loved me And think of me fondly when your hands are on her I hope you're happy, but don't be happier - [Bridge] Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh - [Chorus] I hope you're happy Just not like how you were with me I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go So find someone great, but don't find no one better I hope you're happy but don't be happier​                                   -Olivia Rodrigo​</h2><br />

                            11. Hi can you identify the figure of speech here 
In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;
this Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
And if I need to suffer, 
for You to be glorified, 
I pray that I’ll be reminded 
of how good you are
That this is just a phase, 
and you understand my pain
so I will seek and shout for You
even louder.
You split the sea, so I could walk right through it.
All my fears were drowned in perfect love.
You rescued me so I could stand and sing.
I am a child of God.
You don’t see the wind but you know it’s there. 
You don’t see air but you know it’s there. 
Faith is like that. 
You don’t need to see God but you know he’s there.
Jesus Christ
You are my one desire
Lord hear my only cry
To know You all my life.
I will give you 25 pts.... please this is my project please</h2><br />

                            13. dear MamaYou are appreciatedWhen I was young, me and my mama had beefSeventeen years old, kicked out on the streetsThough back at the time I never thought I'd see her faceAin't a woman alive that could take my mama's placeSuspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a foolWith the big boys breakin' all the rulesI shed tears with my baby sister, over the yearsWe was poorer than the other little kidsAnd even though we had different daddies, the same dramaWhen things went wrong we'd blame MamaI reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hellHuggin' on my mama from a jail cellAnd who'd think in elementary, heyI'd see the penitentiary one day?And runnin' from the police, that's rightMama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backsideAnd even as a crack fiend, MamaYou always was a black queen, MamaI finally understandFor a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a manYou always was committedA poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did itThere's no way I can pay you backBut the plan is to show you that I understandYou are appreciatedLady, don't you know we love you? (Dear Mama)Sweet lady, place no one above you (You are appreciated)Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fairNo love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't thereHe passed away and I didn't cry, 'cause my angerWouldn't let me feel for a strangerThey say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all alongI was lookin' for a father, he was goneI hung around with the thugsAnd even though they sold drugsThey showed a young brother loveI moved out and started really hangin'I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocksIt feels good puttin' money in your mailboxI love payin' rent when the rent's dueI hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you'Cause when I was low you was there for meAnd never left me alone, because you cared for meAnd I could see you comin' home after work lateYou're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plateYou just workin' with the scraps you was givenAnd Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'But now the road got rough, you're aloneYou're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your ownAnd there's no way I can pay you backBut my plan is to show you that I understandYou are appreciatedLady, don't you know we love you? (And dear Mama)Sweet lady, place no one above you (You are appreciated)Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?Pour out some liquor and I reminisce'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mamaAnd when it seems that I'm hopelessYou say the words that can get me back in focusWhen I was sick as a little kidTo keep me happy there's no limit to the things you didAnd all my childhood memoriesAre full of all the sweet things you did for meAnd even though I act crazyI gotta thank the Lord that you made meThere are no words that can express how I feelYou never kept a secret, always stayed realAnd I appreciate how you raised meAnd all the extra love that you gave meI wish I could take the pain awayIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter dayEverything will be alright if you hold onIt's a struggle every day, gotta roll onAnd there's no way I can pay you backBut my plan is to show you that I understandYou are appreciatedLady, don't you know we love you? (Dear Mama)Sweet lady, place no one above you? (You are appreciated)Sweet lady, don't you know we love you? (Dear Mama)Sweet ladyLady (Dear Mama)Lady, lady​</h2><br />
