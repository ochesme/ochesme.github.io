                                            I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and
tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I
have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.” I have a
dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of
former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have
a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day down in Alabama—with its vicious racists, with its
Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification—one
day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with
little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and
mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will
be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
together.”
This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith
we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we
will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
free one day. And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will
be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I
sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside,
let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom
ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that.
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
“From every mountainside, let freedom ring.”
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to
speed up that day when all of God’s children—black men and white men, Jews and
Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of
the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.”

which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the
state of matter.

Gov. Chavit Singson doesn't want the tigers to vanish. These majestic
beasts are disappearing at an alarming rate. Gov. Chavit thinks that we should
write to our congress people. If we let them know that we demand the
preservation of this species, maybe we can make a difference. Gov. Chavit also
thinks that we should donate to Save the Tigers. Our donations will help to
support and empower those who are fighting the hardest to preserve the tigers.
We owe it to our grandchildren to do something.

On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</a>

                            4. I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and
tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I
have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.” I have a
dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of
former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have
a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day down in Alabama—with its vicious racists, with its
Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification—one
day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with
little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and
mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will
be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
together.”
This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith
we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we
will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
free one day. And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will
be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I
sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside,
let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom
ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that.
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
“From every mountainside, let freedom ring.”
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to
speed up that day when all of God’s children—black men and white men, Jews and
Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of
the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.”

"Well, that means only Alex gets to play for the rest of the day. While you, Isidro, will finish your chores and stay home the rest of the day."Isidro felt bad, but he knew his parents were right.

physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of malter
All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and
matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be day.
Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the
matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter
Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the
with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and
will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes
are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent,
which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the
state of matter.

Gov. Chavit Singson doesn't want the tigers to vanish. These majestic
beasts are disappearing at an alarming rate. Gov. Chavit thinks that we should
write to our congress people. If we let them know that we demand the
preservation of this species, maybe we can make a difference. Gov. Chavit also
thinks that we should donate to Save the Tigers. Our donations will help to
support and empower those who are fighting the hardest to preserve the tigers.
We owe it to our grandchildren to do something.

2. Create a critique of the topic and evaluate whether or not the text is worth sharing
with other people.
Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic presented is a personal opinion on the pros and cons of owning a car in the Philippines. The writer discusses the inconvenience of relying on public transportation and the benefits of owning a car. They acknowledge the financial burden that comes with owning a car but believe that the additional expense is worth the benefits it provides.</p><p></p><p>While the writer's personal experience and perspective are valid, the article could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the issue. For instance, the article does not consider the environmental impact of owning a car, which is a significant concern in the modern world. Additionally, the writer does not consider alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or motorcycles, which could provide similar benefits at a lower cost.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the article lacks statistical evidence or research to back up the claims made, which would have added credibility to the author's opinion. The writer could have provided additional sources and data to support their argument and provide a more well-rounded view of the topic.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the article provides a personal opinion on owning a car in the Philippines, but it lacks a thorough analysis of the issue. It could benefit from more research and evidence to support the author's perspective. However, the topic is still worth sharing with others as it can initiate a conversation on the pros and cons of owning a car and encourage people to consider alternative modes of transportation.</p><br />
