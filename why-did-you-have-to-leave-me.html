I hope it did not tire you. PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not fire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand. but when it comes to thirty-one million... ugh!

                                            D. Read the text below and answer the questions that follow.I had just reached the railway station and was waiting for my train to arrive as I had to travel to Jaipur for a family function of my friend. When I asked the Train Enquiry Department, they told me that the train will arrive at 9.00 pm, which meant I had to wait for an extra hour. So I tried to pass my time by having a look at the station and the things happening there. Since it was a small station, there were very few passengers.I saw a group of boys playing with the pebbles. The boys were all dressed up quite pathetically as their clothes were very dirty and torn. But still they were quite happy with the pebbles and were enjoying to the fullest.
Suddenly I developed an urge to drink tea as it was a cold evening, but to my misfortune, I couldn’t find any tea vendors at the station. The only tea vendor was sitting outside the station and I couldn’t take the risk of leaving all my luggage at the station just to drink the tea.I called one of the boys from the guys and asked him to bring me a cup of tea by handing him a coin of 5 rupees. He agreed and went to bring me the tea. Time passed and after half an hour, I heard the announcement which said that my train would be arriving in a couple of minutes. Now I was sure that the child ran away with the money and cursed myself for trusting a road side boy. I stood up to pick my luggage as the train arrived. I was just about to enter the coach when I heard a voice which said, “Babuji, Apki chai” (translates to ‘Sir, your tea’).Surprised with the voice, I looked back and asked him, “Why did he bring the tea so late?”He told me, he lost the 5 rupees coin and so he had to clean the utensils of the tea vendor, to bring me a cup of tea.
1. What did the man think when the boy did not return at once?___________________________________________________________2. What took the boy too long to return?___________________________________________________________3. What do you think the man felt after knowing it? Why?___________________________________________________________4. Does his experience reflect bias or prejudice? Why?___________________________________________________________5.

Still I Rise Poem by Maya Angelou You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room. Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I'll rise. Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops, Weakened by my soulful cries? Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own backyard. You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise. Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I've got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave. Raise your Flag Sung by KZ Tandingan What do you wanna be? Will you believe me if I tell you You can be anything you want? Where do you wanna go? Will you believe me if I tell you That you'll see the silver lining with your dreams? 'Cause when they say we can't, we have to be braver Together we'll reach for the impossible Even when you think that it's crazy The longest journey begins with a single step from you and me Raise your flag For the ones who think they can't get somewhere Raise your flag For the ones who think no one believes in them Raise your flag For the ones who already feel like giving up I stand here, not as one For we're all in this together Reach high and raise your flag Raise your flag Raise your flag, oh oh Raise your flag Don't ever let them put you down You're a fighter Never saying never And learn to lift each other up We'll be stronger If we get together, we'll be soaring even higherpls pasagot ng tamareport nonesense.​</a>

children and went about her tasks happily–fetching water, gathering gabi
leaves, and digging camote for supper.
Once cloudy day, when the Sun was home, the Moon had to go to the river
for water. She crooned the children to sleep and called to her husband.
“Dear husband, I am going to fetch water. Watch over the children, but do
not go near them because you know what will happen if you do.” And after
the warning, she left.
The Sun looked lovingly at his children. He had never before been able to
really know them or even get near them. Overcome with love and affection,
he kissed them. To his horror, they shriveled up before his eyes and
crumbled to ashes.
His anguish was great. He moaned and cried. Suddenly he remembered
what her wife had told–not to touch the children! Not knowing what to do,
he hid in the forest.
Soon after this the Moon returned. A water jar was balanced on her head
and she carried a bundle of freshly cut gabi leaves in her arms. Laying down
the jar and leaves, she turned to look for her children. Wild was her grief to
find only ashes where her lovely brown babies had once been.
Her screams and lamentations reached her husband in the forest, and his
pity overcoming his fear, he went home. However, as soon as the Moon saw
him, her wailing became louder.
“My husband, why did you do it? Did I not tell you never to touch or even
draw near our children? Why did you disobey me?”
“I couldn’t help kissing them, O wife; they looked so sweet. I have never
seen anything so sweet before. Forgive me, O moon! Forgive me,” he
begged her.
But the Moon would not be comforted. Her reproaches increased in
intensity. In the end, the Sun got angry.
“Mang-ad!” he shouted. “Did you say that I disobeyed you? How dare you
think that you are superior to me, that you can order me what to do. Mang-
ad! Slave! How dare you say that I disobeyed you!”
“Ai!” she moaned. “I am nothing, nothing at all! Then, my children are
nothing too!” And with one defiant sweep of her arm, she scattered their
ashes to the four winds.
Horrified and enraged, the Sun seized the gabi leaves and threw them in his
wife’s face and dashed out of the house.
When he returned very late that night, his ill temper was gone. He regretted
having shouted at his wife. He found the house dark and empty. His wife
had fled, but pinpoints of glimmering light in the distance told him where
she was, for he knew the lights were his children following their mother in
her flight.
So started the endless cycle of the Sun chasing the Moon and the Moon
fleeing from the Sun. The Moon is forever with her children, the many tiny
lights we call stars. Now and then a shooting star breaks across the path of
the Moon. It is nothing more than an attempt from her husband to make
her and their two children return to him. But the Moon speeds away faster,
sometimes leaving the sky altogether, with only her star-babies there. This
happens when the marks of the gabi leaves on the Moon’s face swell, and
she remembers the pain and humiliation of her husband’s anger when he
threw the gabi leaves to her face and called her mang-ad (property) and
binotong (slave).

And the silly animal jumped into the well.At once the fox leapt on to the goat's back. And from there he soon jumped out of the well."Hey! Where are you going?" cried the goat. "What about me? How am I going to get out of here?""Ah-ha, you silly goat," laughed the fox.

                                            Once there were two brothers. Anpu was the elder, and Bata was the younger. When their parents died, Anpu was already married and had a house of his own, so he took his little brother with him and treated him like his son. When the little brother grew to be a young man, he became an excellent worker. He did the plowing. He harvested the corn, and there was no one his equal in the whole land. Behold, the spirit of the god was within him.Every morning, the younger brother followed his oxen and worked all day in the fields, and every evening, he returned to the house with vegetables, milk, and wood. He laid all these before his elder brother, and he took with him his bread, and he drove the cattle into the field.Because Anpu loved his younger brother very much, his wife became very jealous and she wanted to destroy Bata. One day, when Anpu and Bata were in the fields, they needed some corn, so Anpu sent Bata home to get some. The younger brother found the wife combing her hair and said to her, “Get up and give me some corn that I may run to the field for my elder brother is in a hurry. Do not delay.”At eventide, Anpu returned home earlier than his brother because Bata had much work to do in the fields. Anpu was met by his wife, who was crying bitterly. She showed him her arms and legs which he had painted black and blue and accused Bata of having beaten her up. She pretended to be in great pain. She did not give him water to wash his hands with. She did not light the fire for him. She pretended that she was very sick.Anpu became very angry. He sharpened his knife and waited for Bata in the stable. When the sun went down, Bata came home as usual, loaded with herbs, milk and wood. As he entered the door, he saw the feet of his brother and the sharp knife hanging by his side. The brother sprang from him and Bata fled praying to the god Ra. “My good Lord! Save me from death, thou who divines the evil from the good.” Ra heard his cry. He made a river flow between one brother and the other and filled it with crocodiles.Bata asked his elder brother, “Why do you seek to kill me? Am I not your brother and have you not always treated me as if you were my father? Has not your wife been as mother to me? Now since you want to kill me, I shall go to the Valley of the Acacia.”Anpu answered, “Why did you beat up my wife and almost kill her.”Bata answered, “I did not do such thing. Have I told you that I have always looked upon her as my mother?”So, Anpu went home. He found his wife near the river washing off the black and blue dye with which she had painted herself. Filled with great anger, Anpu killed his wife and cast her to the dogs. Then, he sat down, poured ashes on his head and mourned for his younger brother. Bata reached the Valley of Acacia. Since there was no one with him, he slew wild beasts for food, built himself a house and met the Nine Gods who knew of his innocence and goodness. Ra said to the god Khunumu, “Behold, frame a woman for Bata that he may not remain alone.” So Khunumu made for Bata a wife to dwell with him. She was indeed more beautiful than any other woman in the whole land. She was like a goddess, and Bata loved her very much.
1.why did the wife get jealous of bata? 2.What did the wife do to get the attention of anpu? Do you agree with what she had done? why so? 3. if you were bata ,what would you do? Do you agree with him in leaving the house? Why so? 4. If you were anpu,would you believe your wife's explanation​</a>

                                            Love and TimeOnce upon a time all feelings and emotions went to a coastal island for a vacation.According to their nature, each was having a good time. Suddenly, warning of animpending storm was announced and everyone was advised to evacuate the island.The announcement caused sudden panic. All rushed to their boats. Even damagedboats were quickly repaired and commissioned for duty.Yet, Love did not wish to flee quickly. There was so much to do. But as the cloudsdarkened, Love realized it was time to leave. Alas, there were no boats to spare. Lovelooked around with hope.Just then Prosperity passed by in a luxurious boat. Love shouted, “Prosperity,could you please take me in your boat?”“No,” replied Prosperity, “my boat is full of precious possessions, gold and silver.There is no place for you.”A little later Vanity came by in a beautiful boat. Again, Love shouted, “Could youhelp me, Vanity? I am stranded and need a lift. Please take me with you.”Vanity responded haughtily, “No, I cannot take you with me. My boat will getsoiled with your muddy feet.”Sorrow passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was to noavail. “No, I cannot take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be by myself.”When Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help. ButHappiness was so happy that it did not look around, hardly concerned about anyone. Love was growing restless and dejected. Just then somebody called out, “ComeLove, I will take you with me.” It was an elder.Love did not know who was being so magnanimous, “Do you know who sogenerously gave me a lift just when no one else wished to help?”Knowledge smiled, “Oh, that was Time.”“And why would Time stop to pick me and take me to safety?” Love wondered.Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and replied, “Because only Time knows yourtrue greatness and what you are capable of. Only Love can bring peace and greathappiness in this world.”What is the plot of this po? Please answer. Thank you.​</a>

FACE: Okay, tell me. . . who among did it?
WHEELS AND WEIGHTS [Aloud]: Surely not we!
HANDS: Don’t look at us. It’s not we either.
PENDULUM [Sheepishly]: I did it! The truth is. . . I’m tired of tick-tocking and swaying for
fifty years. I give up!
FACE [Angrily]: You lazy thing! How could you!
PENDULUM: It is easy for you, Lady Face, to set yourself above me and accuse me of laziness.
You do nothing but look pretty and stare at people and watch all that go in and on in the kitchen.
How would you like to be in the dark closet and do nothing but wag back and forth year after
year like I do? I’m tired of my life. After thinking it over last night, I figured out how many
times in a month do I have to tick while the Hour Hand just goes around once. Do you have
any idea how many times that is?
MINUTE HAND [Brightly speaking up]: Forty-three thousand two hundred times!
PENDULUM: Right! And in one week, how many times must I wag?
MINUTE HAND [Thinking]: Ten thousand eighty.
PENDULUM: Exactly! And in one year?
3
MINUTE HAND [Thinking harder]:. .Er-r-r. Let me think.
HOUR HAND: Take your time, dear; you can do it.
MINUTE HAND [Shouting]: Thirty-one million four hundred and forty-nine thousand six
hundred! Half ticks and half ticks. There is silence. Everyone waits for the Pendulum to say
whether the answer is correct or not. And then. .
PENDULUM: Very good, smart fellow! Now, you all see why I’m tired of ticktocking. It’s too
much to ask of anyone. So please count me out.
FACE: Mr. Pendulum, would you mind wagging six times, only six times to please a lady?
PENDULUM: With pleasure! Here. . . tick-tock, tick-tock.
FACE: Thank you, I hope it did not tire you.
PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing

the country – Juba, South Judan 
“The human race shall always overcome,” 
said Jommo Kenyatta 
See, I am the ultimate test 
How well do you work together? How 
well coordinated are you? 
Covid 19 is my name 
I know no boundaries or lanes 
No celebrity can match my fame 
Like a roaring flame I engulf all on my path 
The poor and the rich both feel my wrath 
You have a common enemy in me So, 
lower your guns and focus on mellower 
your rank, tribe, ethnicity and focus on me 
For can’t you see, can’t you see 
I know off no hierarchy 
My presence brings fear and anarchy 
I stronger than Samson 
For I break the unbreakable 
I’ll break your economy 
I’ll break your faith 
But that’s only if you let me 
For the racism you show only strengthens me 
You like hiding your identity, then wear a 
mask 
You claim that your hands are clean, then 
sanitize 
For the death I cause is no man’s fault but 
rather my nature 
You shall overcome me; it’s in your blood, it’s 
your nature 
I am no professor, neither is this a lecture 
As nations cower in fear 
For I grab many victims in a day For 
once they see something worse than war 
For once they see humanity is worth 
fighting for 
What goes up must come down 
No authority is higher than me 
For I break the laws of traditions 
I break the laws of a normal condition 
But I’ll never break the so-called men 
Bend them to their breaking points 
Once they kill me, they forget my wrath 
and once again I’ll strike 
As you suffer because of me Also try 
and learn from me and your 
mistakes 
As I go down the books of history 
Still there’s more to come 
Maintain the togetherness And 
there will be no harm 
Share the little you have 
Before I strike and leave you with none 
The only way to survive me, is by joining 
heads 
Lock your doors for I roam the streets 
Stay alert for like an assassin; you never 
know my target. 
But only working together can tame my

                                            Love and TimeOnce upon a time all feelings and emotions went to a coastal island for a vacation. According to their nature, each was having a good time. Suddenly, waming of an impending storm was announced and everyone was advised to evacuate the island.The announcement caused sudden panic. All rushed to their boats. Even damaged boats were quickly repaired and commissioned for duty Yet, Love did not wish to flee quickly. There was so much to do. But as the cloudsdarkened, Love realized it was time to leave. Alas, there were no boats to spare. Love looked around with hope Just then Prosperity passed by in a luxurious boat. Love shouted, "Prosperity.could you please take me in your boat?" "No," replied Prosperity, "my boat is full of precious possessions, gold and silver. There is no place for you."A little later Vanity came by in a beautiful boat. Again, Love shouted, "Couldyou help me, Vanity? I am stranded and need a lift. Please take me with you."Vanity responded haughtily, "No, I cannot take you with me. My boat will getsoiled with your muddy feet." Sorrow passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was tono avail. "No, I cannot take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be by myself."When Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help.But Happiness was so happy that it did not look around, hardly concerned aboutanyone. Love was growing restless and dejected. Just then somebody called out "Come Love, I will take you with me." Love did not know who was being so magnanimous, do you know who so generously gave me a lift just when no one else wished to help?"Knowledge smiled, "Oh, that was Time.""And why would Time stop to pick me and take me to safety?" Love wondered. Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and replied, "Because only Time knows your true greatness and what you are capable of. Only Love can bring peace and great happiness in this world."​</a>

                            7. D. Read the text below and answer the questions that follow.I had just reached the railway station and was waiting for my train to arrive as I had to travel to Jaipur for a family function of my friend. When I asked the Train Enquiry Department, they told me that the train will arrive at 9.00 pm, which meant I had to wait for an extra hour. So I tried to pass my time by having a look at the station and the things happening there. Since it was a small station, there were very few passengers.I saw a group of boys playing with the pebbles. The boys were all dressed up quite pathetically as their clothes were very dirty and torn. But still they were quite happy with the pebbles and were enjoying to the fullest.
Suddenly I developed an urge to drink tea as it was a cold evening, but to my misfortune, I couldn’t find any tea vendors at the station. The only tea vendor was sitting outside the station and I couldn’t take the risk of leaving all my luggage at the station just to drink the tea.I called one of the boys from the guys and asked him to bring me a cup of tea by handing him a coin of 5 rupees. He agreed and went to bring me the tea. Time passed and after half an hour, I heard the announcement which said that my train would be arriving in a couple of minutes. Now I was sure that the child ran away with the money and cursed myself for trusting a road side boy. I stood up to pick my luggage as the train arrived. I was just about to enter the coach when I heard a voice which said, “Babuji, Apki chai” (translates to ‘Sir, your tea’).Surprised with the voice, I looked back and asked him, “Why did he bring the tea so late?”He told me, he lost the 5 rupees coin and so he had to clean the utensils of the tea vendor, to bring me a cup of tea.

What took the boy too long to return?___________________________________________________________3. What do you think the man felt after knowing it?

Still I Rise Poem by Maya Angelou You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room. Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I'll rise. Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops, Weakened by my soulful cries? Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own backyard. You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise. Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I've got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave. Raise your Flag Sung by KZ Tandingan What do you wanna be? Will you believe me if I tell you You can be anything you want? Where do you wanna go? Will you believe me if I tell you That you'll see the silver lining with your dreams? 'Cause when they say we can't, we have to be braver Together we'll reach for the impossible Even when you think that it's crazy The longest journey begins with a single step from you and me Raise your flag For the ones who think they can't get somewhere Raise your flag For the ones who think no one believes in them Raise your flag For the ones who already feel like giving up I stand here, not as one For we're all in this together Reach high and raise your flag Raise your flag Raise your flag, oh oh Raise your flag Don't ever let them put you down You're a fighter Never saying never And learn to lift each other up We'll be stronger If we get together, we'll be soaring even higherpls pasagot ng tamareport nonesense.​</h2><br />

children and went about her tasks happily–fetching water, gathering gabi
leaves, and digging camote for supper.
Once cloudy day, when the Sun was home, the Moon had to go to the river
for water. She crooned the children to sleep and called to her husband.
“Dear husband, I am going to fetch water. Watch over the children, but do
not go near them because you know what will happen if you do.” And after
the warning, she left.
The Sun looked lovingly at his children. He had never before been able to
really know them or even get near them. Overcome with love and affection,
he kissed them. To his horror, they shriveled up before his eyes and
crumbled to ashes.
His anguish was great. He moaned and cried. Suddenly he remembered
what her wife had told–not to touch the children! Not knowing what to do,
he hid in the forest.
Soon after this the Moon returned. A water jar was balanced on her head
and she carried a bundle of freshly cut gabi leaves in her arms. Laying down
the jar and leaves, she turned to look for her children. Wild was her grief to
find only ashes where her lovely brown babies had once been.
Her screams and lamentations reached her husband in the forest, and his
pity overcoming his fear, he went home. However, as soon as the Moon saw
him, her wailing became louder.
“My husband, why did you do it? Did I not tell you never to touch or even
draw near our children? Why did you disobey me?”
“I couldn’t help kissing them, O wife; they looked so sweet. I have never
seen anything so sweet before. Forgive me, O moon! Forgive me,” he
begged her.
But the Moon would not be comforted. Her reproaches increased in
intensity. In the end, the Sun got angry.
“Mang-ad!” he shouted. “Did you say that I disobeyed you? How dare you
think that you are superior to me, that you can order me what to do. Mang-
ad! Slave! How dare you say that I disobeyed you!”
“Ai!” she moaned. “I am nothing, nothing at all! Then, my children are
nothing too!” And with one defiant sweep of her arm, she scattered their
ashes to the four winds.
Horrified and enraged, the Sun seized the gabi leaves and threw them in his
wife’s face and dashed out of the house.
When he returned very late that night, his ill temper was gone. He regretted
having shouted at his wife. He found the house dark and empty. His wife
had fled, but pinpoints of glimmering light in the distance told him where
she was, for he knew the lights were his children following their mother in
her flight.
So started the endless cycle of the Sun chasing the Moon and the Moon
fleeing from the Sun. The Moon is forever with her children, the many tiny
lights we call stars. Now and then a shooting star breaks across the path of
the Moon. It is nothing more than an attempt from her husband to make
her and their two children return to him. But the Moon speeds away faster,
sometimes leaving the sky altogether, with only her star-babies there. This
happens when the marks of the gabi leaves on the Moon’s face swell, and
she remembers the pain and humiliation of her husband’s anger when he
threw the gabi leaves to her face and called her mang-ad (property) and
binotong (slave).

Iking : Yes. Here’s a letter for your father. It must be from your brother Efren. It came from Manila. Here. Take it.
Ninay : Thank you, Mang Iking. I will give this to Father. I’m sure he will be glad to receive news from Kuya Efren. He has been away for more than a month already and we miss him very much.
Iking : He is now studying in Manila, isn’t he?
Ninay : Yes. He wants to be an engineer and I’m sure he will be someday!

Gardo : This must have come from Efren.
Pedro : How do you know?
Efren : “... and I want so much to go back home. The only thing that sustains me in my loneliness is the thought that someday, I will be able to help you lift our family from the poverty we have endured for so long. I shall always be grateful to you, Father.”
Efren : “Please give my love to Mother, Delia, Ninay and Kuya Gardo. You are always on my mind and in my heart...”

Sepa : Now, tell me why you were angry when you came home from the fields, Pedro. Do you have a problem?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The letter is from Efren, the son who is studying in Manila, and it contains his message of love and gratitude towards his family, particularly his father who has endured poverty for so long.The eldest son, Gardo, interpreted the letter positively and with a proud tone of voice. He was not jealous of his brother and instead, he seemed to admire Efren's dedication to his studies and his desire to help lift their family from poverty.The mother, Sepa, interpreted the letter with a loving and emotional tone of voice. She expressed her admiration for Efren's character and considered him a good son. While not all mothers may react in the same way, it is common for parents to feel proud and emotional when receiving messages from their children who are away from home.Both interpretations are valid and can be considered close to Efren's intention. The letter expresses Efren's love and gratitude towards his family, as well as his determination to succeed and help his family overcome poverty. It is possible that Efren intended to convey both the positive emotions and the message of hope for a better future that his family can have with his success.Both interpretations are likable, as they show different perspectives and emotions that can arise from reading a letter from a loved one who is far away. However, the interpretation that focuses on Efren's determination to succeed and help his family can be particularly inspiring and hopeful for others who may also be struggling with poverty or other challenges in their lives.<p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>google nyo po para malaman mo</p><br />

"Oh, I'm drinking," he said."Down there? But there's water in the bucket up here.""Yes, I know," said the fox. "But the water down here is much sweeter.Why don't you come down and taste it for yourself?""I think I will do that." And the silly animal jumped into the well.At once the fox leapt on to the goat's back. And from there he soon jumped out of the well."Hey! Where are you going?" cried the goat. "What about me? How am I going to get out of here?""Ah-ha, you silly goat," laughed the fox.

                            17. Once there were two brothers. Anpu was the elder, and Bata was the younger. When their parents died, Anpu was already married and had a house of his own, so he took his little brother with him and treated him like his son. When the little brother grew to be a young man, he became an excellent worker. He did the plowing. He harvested the corn, and there was no one his equal in the whole land. Behold, the spirit of the god was within him.Every morning, the younger brother followed his oxen and worked all day in the fields, and every evening, he returned to the house with vegetables, milk, and wood. He laid all these before his elder brother, and he took with him his bread, and he drove the cattle into the field.Because Anpu loved his younger brother very much, his wife became very jealous and she wanted to destroy Bata. One day, when Anpu and Bata were in the fields, they needed some corn, so Anpu sent Bata home to get some. The younger brother found the wife combing her hair and said to her, “Get up and give me some corn that I may run to the field for my elder brother is in a hurry. Do not delay.”At eventide, Anpu returned home earlier than his brother because Bata had much work to do in the fields. Anpu was met by his wife, who was crying bitterly. She showed him her arms and legs which he had painted black and blue and accused Bata of having beaten her up. She pretended to be in great pain. She did not give him water to wash his hands with. She did not light the fire for him. She pretended that she was very sick.Anpu became very angry. He sharpened his knife and waited for Bata in the stable. When the sun went down, Bata came home as usual, loaded with herbs, milk and wood. As he entered the door, he saw the feet of his brother and the sharp knife hanging by his side. The brother sprang from him and Bata fled praying to the god Ra. “My good Lord! Save me from death, thou who divines the evil from the good.” Ra heard his cry. He made a river flow between one brother and the other and filled it with crocodiles.Bata asked his elder brother, “Why do you seek to kill me? Am I not your brother and have you not always treated me as if you were my father? Has not your wife been as mother to me? Now since you want to kill me, I shall go to the Valley of the Acacia.”Anpu answered, “Why did you beat up my wife and almost kill her.”Bata answered, “I did not do such thing. Have I told you that I have always looked upon her as my mother?”So, Anpu went home. He found his wife near the river washing off the black and blue dye with which she had painted herself. Filled with great anger, Anpu killed his wife and cast her to the dogs. Then, he sat down, poured ashes on his head and mourned for his younger brother. Bata reached the Valley of Acacia. Since there was no one with him, he slew wild beasts for food, built himself a house and met the Nine Gods who knew of his innocence and goodness. Ra said to the god Khunumu, “Behold, frame a woman for Bata that he may not remain alone.” So Khunumu made for Bata a wife to dwell with him. She was indeed more beautiful than any other woman in the whole land. She was like a goddess, and Bata loved her very much.
1.why did the wife get jealous of bata? 2.What did the wife do to get the attention of anpu? Do you agree with what she had done? why so? 3. if you were bata ,what would you do? Do you agree with him in leaving the house? Why so? 4. If you were anpu,would you believe your wife's explanation​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. She get jealous because Anpu loves Bata so much. </p><p></p><p>2. She pretended that she was in great pain because Bata beat her up even if Bata is innocent. I don't agree with her actions because envy is a sin and it's not nice accuse someone of something they didn't do. </p><p></p><p>3. I would also leave the house like Bata did as I don't want to live in a house full of people who don't like me, didn't trust me and even wanted to end my life.</p><p></p><p>4. I wouldn't believe her  because Bata is my brother and I know he's not that kind of person. </p><br />

                            18. Love and TimeOnce upon a time all feelings and emotions went to a coastal island for a vacation.According to their nature, each was having a good time. Suddenly, warning of animpending storm was announced and everyone was advised to evacuate the island.The announcement caused sudden panic. All rushed to their boats. Even damagedboats were quickly repaired and commissioned for duty.Yet, Love did not wish to flee quickly. There was so much to do. But as the cloudsdarkened, Love realized it was time to leave. Alas, there were no boats to spare. Lovelooked around with hope.Just then Prosperity passed by in a luxurious boat. Love shouted, “Prosperity,could you please take me in your boat?”“No,” replied Prosperity, “my boat is full of precious possessions, gold and silver.There is no place for you.”A little later Vanity came by in a beautiful boat. Again, Love shouted, “Could youhelp me, Vanity? I am stranded and need a lift. Please take me with you.”Vanity responded haughtily, “No, I cannot take you with me. My boat will getsoiled with your muddy feet.”Sorrow passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was to noavail. “No, I cannot take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be by myself.”When Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help. ButHappiness was so happy that it did not look around, hardly concerned about anyone. Love was growing restless and dejected. Just then somebody called out, “ComeLove, I will take you with me.” It was an elder.Love did not know who was being so magnanimous, “Do you know who sogenerously gave me a lift just when no one else wished to help?”Knowledge smiled, “Oh, that was Time.”“And why would Time stop to pick me and take me to safety?” Love wondered.Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and replied, “Because only Time knows yourtrue greatness and what you are capable of. Only Love can bring peace and greathappiness in this world.”What is the plot of this po? Please answer. Thank you.​</h2><br />

FACE: Okay, tell me. . . who among did it?
WHEELS AND WEIGHTS [Aloud]: Surely not we!
HANDS: Don’t look at us. It’s not we either.
PENDULUM [Sheepishly]: I did it! The truth is. . . I’m tired of tick-tocking and swaying for
fifty years. I give up!
FACE [Angrily]: You lazy thing! How could you!
PENDULUM: It is easy for you, Lady Face, to set yourself above me and accuse me of laziness.
You do nothing but look pretty and stare at people and watch all that go in and on in the kitchen.
How would you like to be in the dark closet and do nothing but wag back and forth year after
year like I do? I’m tired of my life. After thinking it over last night, I figured out how many
times in a month do I have to tick while the Hour Hand just goes around once. Do you have
any idea how many times that is?
MINUTE HAND [Brightly speaking up]: Forty-three thousand two hundred times!
PENDULUM: Right! And in one week, how many times must I wag?
MINUTE HAND [Thinking]: Ten thousand eighty.
PENDULUM: Exactly! And in one year?
3
MINUTE HAND [Thinking harder]:. .Er-r-r. Let me think.
HOUR HAND: Take your time, dear; you can do it.
MINUTE HAND [Shouting]: Thirty-one million four hundred and forty-nine thousand six
hundred! Half ticks and half ticks. There is silence. Everyone waits for the Pendulum to say
whether the answer is correct or not. And then. .
PENDULUM: Very good, smart fellow! Now, you all see why I’m tired of ticktocking. It’s too
much to ask of anyone. So please count me out.
FACE: Mr. Pendulum, would you mind wagging six times, only six times to please a lady?
PENDULUM: With pleasure! Here. . . tick-tock, tick-tock.
FACE: Thank you, I hope it did not tire you.
PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing
Happened.

                            26. A. Directions: Read and comprehend the poem “Covid 19” by Steven Kiama Ambrose from 
the country – Juba, South Judan 
“The human race shall always overcome,” 
said Jommo Kenyatta 
See, I am the ultimate test 
How well do you work together? How 
well coordinated are you? 
Covid 19 is my name 
I know no boundaries or lanes 
No celebrity can match my fame 
Like a roaring flame I engulf all on my path 
The poor and the rich both feel my wrath 
You have a common enemy in me So, 
lower your guns and focus on mellower 
your rank, tribe, ethnicity and focus on me 
For can’t you see, can’t you see 
I know off no hierarchy 
My presence brings fear and anarchy 
I stronger than Samson 
For I break the unbreakable 
I’ll break your economy 
I’ll break your faith 
But that’s only if you let me 
For the racism you show only strengthens me 
You like hiding your identity, then wear a 
mask 
You claim that your hands are clean, then 
sanitize 
For the death I cause is no man’s fault but 
rather my nature 
You shall overcome me; it’s in your blood, it’s 
your nature 
I am no professor, neither is this a lecture 
As nations cower in fear 
For I grab many victims in a day For 
once they see something worse than war 
For once they see humanity is worth 
fighting for 
What goes up must come down 
No authority is higher than me 
For I break the laws of traditions 
I break the laws of a normal condition 
But I’ll never break the so-called men 
Bend them to their breaking points 
Once they kill me, they forget my wrath 
and once again I’ll strike 
As you suffer because of me Also try 
and learn from me and your 
mistakes 
As I go down the books of history 
Still there’s more to come 
Maintain the togetherness And 
there will be no harm 
Share the little you have 
Before I strike and leave you with none 
The only way to survive me, is by joining 
heads 
Lock your doors for I roam the streets 
Stay alert for like an assassin; you never

                            29. Love and TimeOnce upon a time all feelings and emotions went to a coastal island for a vacation. According to their nature, each was having a good time. Suddenly, waming of an impending storm was announced and everyone was advised to evacuate the island.The announcement caused sudden panic. All rushed to their boats. Even damaged boats were quickly repaired and commissioned for duty Yet, Love did not wish to flee quickly. There was so much to do. But as the cloudsdarkened, Love realized it was time to leave. Alas, there were no boats to spare. Love looked around with hope Just then Prosperity passed by in a luxurious boat. Love shouted, "Prosperity.could you please take me in your boat?" "No," replied Prosperity, "my boat is full of precious possessions, gold and silver. There is no place for you."A little later Vanity came by in a beautiful boat. Again, Love shouted, "Couldyou help me, Vanity? I am stranded and need a lift. Please take me with you."Vanity responded haughtily, "No, I cannot take you with me. My boat will getsoiled with your muddy feet." Sorrow passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was tono avail. "No, I cannot take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be by myself."When Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help.But Happiness was so happy that it did not look around, hardly concerned aboutanyone. Love was growing restless and dejected. Just then somebody called out "Come Love, I will take you with me." Love did not know who was being so magnanimous, do you know who so generously gave me a lift just when no one else wished to help?"Knowledge smiled, "Oh, that was Time.""And why would Time stop to pick me and take me to safety?" Love wondered. Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and replied, "Because only Time knows your true greatness and what you are capable of. Only Love can bring peace and great happiness in this world."​</h2><br />
