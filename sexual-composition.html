                                            Gettysburg AddressBy Abraham Lincoln1Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.2Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 3We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 4We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that nation might live. 5It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.6But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground. 7The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. 8The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. 9It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. 10It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth./************/1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> In sexual reproduction, an organism combines the genetic information from each of its parents and is genetically unique. In asexual reproduction, one parent copies itself to form a genetically identical offspring.</p><p>Asexual reproduction involves a single parent. It results in offspring that are genetically identical to each other and to the parent.</p><p>Sexual reproduction involves two parents.  It results in offspring with genetic variation. ... In sexually reproducing organisms, each parent contributes half of the genes acquired (at random) by the offspring. Individuals have two of each chromosome and hence two alleles of each gene, one acquired from each parent.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS!</p><br />

                            12. Gettysburg AddressBy Abraham Lincoln1Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.2Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 3We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 4We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that nation might live. 5It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.6But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground. 7The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. 8The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. 9It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. 10It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth./************/1.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Physical fitness involves the performance of the heart and lungs, and the muscles of the body. And, since what we do with our bodies also affects what we can do with our minds, fitness influences to some degree qualities such as mental alertness and emotional stability.Health-related fitness (HRF) is theoretically defined as a multidimensional construct containing the components cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility and body compositionSkill-related fitness is broken down into six different components; agility, speed, power, balance, coordination, reaction time. These skill-related components are movements that are necessary for an individual to successfully demonstrate a variety of motor skills and movement patterns.All forms of exercise burn calories. But body composition exercises combine activities to burn fat and activities to build muscle. That way, you replace fat with lean, tight, strong muscles.Agility is the ability to rapidly change body direction, accelerate, or decelerate. It is influenced by balance, strength, coordination, and skill level.<p></p><p>Define the following terms</p>Gender refers to the social attributes and opportunities associated with being female and male and to the relationships between women and men and girls and boys, as well as to the relations between women and those between men.the quality or state of being sexual: a : the condition of having sex. b : sexual activity. c : expression of sexual receptivity or interest especially when excessive.Gender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender. Gender identity can correlate with a person's assigned sex or can differ from it. In most individuals, the various biological determinants of sex are congruent, and consistent with the individual's gender identity.A gender role, also known as a sex role, is a social role encompassing a range of behaviors and attitudes that are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for a person based on that person's sex. Premarital sex is penetrative vaginal intercourse performed between couples before formal marriage [1, 2]. World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescent as persons between the age group of 10–19 years old [3].<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>H</strong><strong>ope </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>helps </strong></p><br />

His subjects on painting were more on history. Like, the Oath of Horatii.Jean-August-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867) France.His paintings were usually nudes, portraits, and mythological themes. Like “The Apotheosis of homer”.Antonio (1757-1822) Italy. He opened the idea for portraying discrete sexual pleasures by using pure contours with his mythological compositions. The paintings of the Romantic Period gave more emphasis one emotions. Artists expressed as much feeling and passion as it could be on a canvass.Jean Louis Theodore Gericault (1791-1824) France. His masterpieces were energetic, powerful, brilliantly colored, and tightly composed. His famous artworks are the following: The Raft of Medusa and Charging ChasseurEugene Delacroix(1798-1863) France. He was the most influential to most of romantic painters and eventually, his technique was adapted and extended by the impressionist artist, his famous artworks was the Liberty leading the people.Francisco Goya (1746-1828) Spain. He was also a print maker regarded both as the last of the “Old Masters” and the first of the Moderns” one of his famous artwork was Saturn Devouring His Son.Francis Rude (1784-1855) France.
