Hazards and risks includes exposure to accidents, injuries, and losses caused by ignorance,carelessness, poor maintenance, or inadequate facilities,3. Every kitchen has a work triangle consisting of the cleaning and pre-preparation center, mixing andpreserving center, and the cooking and serving center,4. An ideal location for a kitchen is at the hottest side of the food establishment.5. An efficient kitchen layout makes meal preparation easy and fast.6. Every worker shouldn't do work without much stress, discomfort, and undue fatigue,7. The location of the kitchen should be easily accessible from the dining room and the living room.8. Vertical transport of food is difficult and costly.9. The kitchen should be designed in simple lines with fewer corners, openings, and crevices to prevethe entrance of the insects and rodents.10. The one-walled type of kitchen is appropriate for a big kitchen.11. One of the causes in electrical hazards is caused by the grease and oil that accumulates in hoodsranges.12. To protect from the fire, have fire extinguishers ready.13. There is a saying “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of care" to control hazards and risk14. In keeping the food clean, fresh products should be stored first before washing it.15. One of the causes in LPG hazards is the LPG tanks are not turned off after use.​</a>
