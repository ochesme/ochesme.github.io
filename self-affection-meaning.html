                                            Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the lived experiences and struggles of 22, on-campus working students of ISAT U-Miagao Campus. This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire and interview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables. Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite work pressure, working students had good time management both for studies and work, with high self-esteem and good academic performance. The study concluded that participants' dual roles in the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helping these students, especially on their financial needs for them to finish their studies.tittle:author/s: kind:strength:Weakness:importance:pahelp naman sa pr1 namin huhu​</a>
